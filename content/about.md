My name is Santiago Sanchez. I am originally from Barquisimeto, Venezuela and currently live in the United States.
Professionally, I consider myself a physical chemist who works on biological problems and an aspiring physician scientist.
I completed my undergraduate work in Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin where I was a Health Science Scholar
and wrote my senior thesis on a method for non-covalent protein immobilization under the mentorship of Lauren Webb. Previously,
I interned at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis where I spent a brief summer studying
liver cancer and daydreaming during Grand Rounds at the Clinical Center.
While at Texas, I also earned a degree
in the humanities through the Plan II Honors program and was a Junior Fellow in the College of Liberal Arts. I went on to
complete an M.Phil in Chemistry at the University of Cambridge under the mentorship of Sir David Klenerman where I worked on a 
project using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to study diffraction-limited aggregates of alpha-synuclein, a protein
which aggregates in the context of neurodegenerative disease, e.g. in Parkinson's and dementia with Lewy bodies. I am currently a medical
student at Stanford Medical School.

This blog is an outlet for my hyperactive imagination and a place where I work through my own thoughts by attempting to write
them down in a way that might make sense to other people. The name is *prima facie* because a lot of what I write in this blog
is a first impression on something that's been on my mind. Since I've been updating this blog for a few years, a lot of this stuff is pretty old. If you're wondering whether I, today, disagree with myself at any point in the past, the answer is always yes.
