My name is Santiago Sanchez. I am originally from Barquisimeto, Venezuela and currently live in the United States.
Professionally, I consider myself a physical chemist who works on biological problems and an aspiring physician scientist.

This blog is an outlet for my hyperactive imagination and a place where I work through my own thoughts by attempting to write
them down in a way that might make sense to other people. The name is *prima facie* because a lot of what I write in this blog
is a first impression on something that's been on my mind. Since I've been updating this blog for a few years, a lot of this stuff is pretty old. If you're wondering whether I, today, disagree with myself at any point in the past, the answer is always yes.
