title: should clerkships be graded?

This blog post is going to be niche med student content, my apologies in advance. 

First, some background.

Towards the beginning of the pandemic--I know, ancient history, but try to remember--Stanford Med radically altered the clerkship schedule and even temporarily pulled clinical med students from the wards. As a result of this disruption to the natural order of medical education, clerkship grading was suspending and replaced with a binary Pass/Fail system which parallels the grading system used during the preclinical years of our medical education (prior to the pandemic our grading system went Fail/Pass/Pass With Distinction, or PWD, aka "Honors"). More than two years later we're still in the same global pandemic, but med students have been back on the old, regular clerkship schedule for over a year...and grading is still Pass/Fail. Indeed, for the vast majority of this year's graduating class who started their clerkship education during the pandemic, the entirety of their medical education--preclinical and clinical--has been graded on a Pass/Fail basis. 

The undercurrent here is driven by years of student advocacy aiming to change the way clerkship grading is done, indeed eliminating it permanently, primarily spearheaded by SUMMA (the umbrella organization within the med student body composed of the various minority student groups). This advocacy has continued and intensified now that the med school finds itself at a crossroads: should we bring back clinical grades? Keep pass/fail? Do something else? A committee made up of faculty and students has convened to answer these questions and make recommendations to the medical school's faculty senate. In this blog post I will make an argument for why I think the clerkship grading scheme should at the very least change and most likely never bring back PWD/Honors at all. 

I'll go in depth below but I'm going to make the tl;dr version of my argument up front. 

tl;dr: Clerkship grading in medical school serves primarily two purposes. The first is as a tool to help students evaluate their performance and progress as physicians-in-training. In this respect, clerkship grading is almost certainly adding no additional value beyond the feedback medical students receive from their team and patients; indeed, the grade contains less information, is less actionable, and is produced by a system riddled with biases, limitations, and fundamental design flaws. The second is arguably more salient but purely instrumental: clerkship grading is used by residency program directors to evaluate applicants and is therefore a mechanism for students to distinguish themselves, particularly in highly competitive specialties. I think that virtually every medical student in the country will agree with me that grading utterly fails in its first role, but the second point is more controversial. It is definitively true that clerkship grades are important to program directors (PD), indeed program directors have said as much in the literature, at forums, and in the NRMP PD survey and support clerkship grades for this reason. Here I would argue that clerkship grades are not the right instrument for differentiating medical students and the root problem PDs face--too many applications to read, too little time, too few interview slots--is better solved through other means, like application caps. Therefore, the decision to abolish clerkship grades has two dimensions of impact. The first is student wellness: in theory, the removal of a biased, unhelpful, and imperfect system of evaluation should allow students to focus on getting the most of their clerkships and perhaps more importantly their lives rather than investing additional time to impressing evaluators. The second is residency placement: could abolishing clerkship grades negatively impact the ability of students to match their preferred programs or specialties? I think abolishing clerkship grades is a clear win for wellness, granting that "making med students well" is a herculean task. As for residency placement, I do not think it is obviously true, as is often implied, that abolishing clerkship grading would have a *negative* impact, or that its presence has a *positive* impact.

In a perfect world, a grade is an accurate assessment of performance and its primary purpose is to help the learner understand their current level of competency and growth. In the real world, grades are highly imperfect. They are limited by the content being tested, by the rubrics and yardsticks that are used in their determination, by the biases (conscious or unconscious) inherent to the systemic practice of grading, to the individual graders, to the learner themselves -- and, finally, to the social, cultural, and political mores which buttress the learning environment. Let me explain. 

1. The content being tested.

What are medical students graded on? At Stanford, you could receive a grade for each of three distinct elements of a specific clerkship rotation: professionalism, clinical performance, and the shelf exam (a standardized test specific to a particular rotation). In the realm of clinical performance people are graded on a RIME scheme where each letter represents a different level of competency or mastery: Reporter, Interpreter, Manager, Educator. I'm not going to go in depth on this, but if you're interested in this system it's used at many medical schools across the country and you can read more about it [here](https://www.med.unc.edu/medclerk/education/grading/rime-framework/). To anyone who hasn't been to medical school, this all probably sounds very reasonable. Professionalism? I certainly want my medical professional to be a professional. Clinical acumen? That's exactly what students are here to develop! Etc. But if you've been to medical school...you're well aware of the problems here. Professionalism and clinical performance are graded primarily based on evaluations written by  supervising resident and attending physicians. 

It is generally true across institutions that students find these evaluations to be at the very least subjective if not completely arbitrary, depending more on your subjective relationship with the members of a particular team in the short time they have to interact with you on a rotation than your actual skills, efforts, or knowledge. There is even a long running meme of the classic clerkship eval that captures this nearly universal experience in medical education: "an excellent student, performs at the level of an intern, fantastic knowledge base. Keep reading, 3/5". 

Furthermore, I take issue with the premise of med student evaluation; that is, that the most desirable or superlative outcome is to be evaluated as performing above your current training level. It is every med student's dream to read "performing at or above the level of an intern" on their evaluation. Look, I get that it's not that deep, that it's meant to say that all expectations and then some have been met. My issue is with the psychological impact of designing a training system which is, at every stage, expecting you to perform above your level of training in order to feel "adequate". I do not think that we should expect less of our students, but we should think about creating a culture where learners are taught to aim for growth, critical self-reflection, and clear performance milestones rather than perfection. A system which continuously reinforces over-delivery, hyperproductivity, and stretching oneself beyond ones current capabilities before one is even really cognizant of ones strengths and weaknesses cannot be good for the long-term mental health of our trainees, particularly because it is that same mentality learned in undergraduate medical education which will carry over into residency and beyond. 

The shelf exam is another problem entirely. Although the test is standardized, how students are able or allowed to prepare for it is certainly not. These exams are tough and students are often given no protected time on rotations to prepare for them, relying instead on weekends, nights, or free moments in the workday to prepare, immediately placing students with personal or family obligations, health needs, or disabilities at a disadvantage compared to their peers. These exams also feature the same structural issues as all other standardized exams employed in the US: minorities, first-gen and low-income students are more likely to underperform relative to their peers. The overwhelming sentiment here, even now in the early days of our formal process to re-evaluate grading, is that this element should never again have a PWD element.
