The quadrennial media circus provoked by the presidential election is a very special time. It's as if a great big bag of smelling salts is spilled over the nation while we sleep, and then, the very next day, as the stulting gears of the campaign and propaganda machines begin rolling, we are collectively aroused to confront the realities of our political system. People sort themselves rapidly and violently into political bins with the expectation that something of incredible importance is about to happen. 

It's a great time of year because even while politicians will lie through their teeth at every opportunity about their own convictions in the cynical attempt to market themselves to the minority which actually determines the results of national elections, the media is incredibly honest. Not in actual fact because there probably isn't a more significant period of obfuscation, fabrication, and farcity across the narrow breadth of the American political spectrum than the period of the presidential election. However, the media bares nakedly for all to see their loyalties and values.

I'm going to talk mostly about third parties and Clinton. First, I'm just going to get some things out of the way. I'm not equating Clinton to Trump; the political crime you are charged with when leveling any criticism, no matter how mild, towards the Democratic nominee (according to a Glen Greenwald tweet I can't find at the moment). Trump is a pathological liar, a fraud of the first degree, of no use to productive society, and, most likely, an idiot who has never had an opinion for any other reason than self-benefit. He is a lunatic, a tyrant, a cheat, the physical embodiment of brazen machista corporate largesse willing to steamroll any principle, value, or human in the cynical pursuit of power, wealth, and personal gain. To even consider his candidacy as an option feels like a serious moral concession. I hope that is enough to acquit myself of the high treason of false equivalency. 

[This morning I saw this article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/29/why-no-one-should-vote-for-gary-johnston-or-jill-stein.html?via=desktop&source=facebook) succinctly titled, "Why no one should vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein" in HuffPo. I will admit I did not read the section on Gary Johnson. You shouldn't vote for Gary Johnson because American Libertarianism is nonsense, full stop. It doesn't matter who his favorite foreign leader is, or whether he has any knowledge of current events because his principles do not make any sense and his political record should scandalize anyone who cares about human freedom and democracy, values he apparently supports. The subtitle of the article warns us: 

>There’s no such thing as a pure protest vote. You’re also voting for something—and these two stand for many deeply troubling ideas. 

Insightful. When we vote, we vote for *something*. I'm not being sarcastic. Although it has taken full year into the presidential election season, someone has finally admitted that the principles of the voter and the candidate they are voting for should have something to do with one another. Let's take a look at how this relates to the Stein vote. The article has this to say:

>About 90,000 voters in Florida in 2000 thought they were just having their jollies. Instead, those Ralph Nader voters did end up doing their part in helping to give us George W. Bush, which in turn gave us Iraq and the Great Recession and all the rest of it. I really hope that people in swing states figured out post-2000 that all that did end up having consequences. But I would extend the argument against Stein beyond swing states. Again, a protest vote is also a vote for something. So what is Stein for? A few progressive things. And a few things that sound progressive but aren’t—notably, forgiveness of all existing college debt. This sounds progressive, but as Jordan Weissman explained at Slate, it’s actually a huge giveaway to the upper middle class, who hold a disproportionate share of that debt. But the weirdest thing about Stein is her apparent affinity for Vladimir Putin. You read that right. She went to Moscow and met with Putin, and was even seated at his table. Russian Green Party activists rebuked her for not even mentioning human rights and LGBT rights when she met with Putin. I don’t know Stein, so I can’t say why, but I can tell you that in general terms, there is within the far left of Stein’s generation (she’s 66) an idea inherited from the Cold War that holds that to be too critical of Russia is on some level to endorse the presumptions and priorities of the American war machine. It’s for reasons related to this that you see a fair amount of quasi-apologetics for Putin on the American far left. Her own website boasts—actually boasts—that after Putin listened to her speech in Moscow, he responded: “What I would like to say, something really unexpected, when I was watching this material. When I was listening to your comments, politicians from other countries, you know what I caught myself thinking about? I agree with them, on many issues.” Imagine the oily smile that lit across her face as Putin spoke these words, and please give some thought to the question of this being your progressive alternative.

I apologize for the big block quote but I didn't want to miss one of the points here. First, there is the typical allusion to Ralph Nader, which apparently is necessary because, [as the NYT asserts in another recent article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-millennials-third-party.html?_r=0), millenials do not remember Nader and therefore do not understand that voting for a third party is awful and leads to terrible things, wars of aggression, torture, etc. I'm going to be very generous and say: Nevermind the fact that George W. Bush "gave us Iraq" (I was under the impression that a [bipartisan vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution) in the House and Senate gave us the Iraq war) is misleading and that the assertion that he gave us the "Great Recession" is garbage. The Bush tax cuts were disastrous, No Child Left Behind was a terrible idea with catastrophic consequences, etc. but the "Great Recession" was the result of decades of unregulated financial speculation and massive fraud perpetrated over a long period of time under Democrats and Republicans with no oversight. It is very odd that the author would pick the two international catastrophes which could have been prevented by not just Bush but by the Democratic party through either legislative or executive action over a long period of time. Let's forget that millions of Democratic voters voted for Bush in 2000, let's forget that Gore won the popular vote by a margin of 500,000 votes. Let's forget that the Florida recount was stopped by the US SCOTUS and declared the president by fiat, let's forget all of that because it was the 90,000 Nader voters in Florida which took, nay *robbed*, the election away from Paragon of Freedom and Justice Al Gore and gave it to Ill-lettered Holy Crusader G.W. Bush. Let's, as the author suggests, focus on what Stein is *for*, because, remember, in the American political system the only thing that matters is consequences, and, of course, what candidates are for always directly leads to consequences related to what they campaigned for and the authenticity of that connection is only to be examined if it means that Evil Loses and Less Evil Wins. Let's put aside how utterly comtemptible of democracy this position is to begin with. 

So, what is Stein for? She is for forgiveness of all student debt. The author says, "sounds nice and progressive, right? WRONG!" (Patrick Stewart Meme) and it isn't progressive because it is a "massive giveaway to the upper middle class, who hold a disproportionate share of that debt". That is one part of a much [broader policy](http://www.gp.org/the_green_party_on_education) which aims to make education free for every student. The original source of this criticism is a [Slate article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/07/27/jill_stein_is_not_the_savior_the_left_is_looking_for.html) which in turn references an article in the [Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/10/grad-students-the-few-the-proud-the-indebted/280396/) to substantiate its claim. The assertion is a little misleading, but let's just concede that it is true. That does not somehow invalidate the policy. The point of the policy, however it is manufactured, is that all school debt is forgiven. The further point is that all public education is paid for in this country from here on out, in full. This way, there is no incentive for the government or private entitites to make money from student debt and it fixes the accessibility problem (which may explain why the upper middle class has all of the debt, they are the only ones who can afford to go to college in the first place), namely, by eliminating it. The Slate article then descends into a wonkish tantrum about how Stein did not have a plan to implement this, or how she said something very vague and misleading about what quantitative easing is to say something along the lines of "let's do for students, what the federal government did for banks through quantitative easing". I don't think anyone who really thinks education should be free for everyone at every level will agree 100% on how it should be done. We agreee on one thing: We know we can do it. There are a million ways to do it. Finding a way to do it is secondary to understanding that it ought to be done. In a sane country, that would be referred to as having principles. Further, I don't think Stein is wrong in the actual substance of her statement, sans "quantitative easing", in that what the government did for the mortgage markets was nationalize the debt, probably the largest single nationalization ever to take place in U.S. History. If we can do that when millions of people lose their homes without holding anyone responsible for the crisis accountable, I think we can write off student debt if we really wanted to do it. 

Second, and this is a much graver crime in this election cycle, Stein has a "strange affinity for Vladimir Putin", a charge leveled time and time again against Trump in the new red-baiting tactic...fascist-baiting? It's hard to say because Putin is clearly not a communist and neither is Trump but the Soros [propaganda website, PutinTrump.org](http://putintrump.org/) features a hammer and sickle so there must be, at some level, an understanding of how "red-baity" this fascist-baiting is. I don't even know what to say to this. Should she have sat down with Putin? Yah, probably not because it's weird to break bread with fascists but it's ridiculous to suggest her mere appearance at a conference in Moscow is somehow equivalent to "an affinity for Putin". It would be like saying "Hillary has a strange affinity for Donald Trump because she went to his wedding". It would be absurd if it were said about her, and it is absurd here too. Why would anyone ever go to an event hosted by Putin? I don't know, why would anyone ever go to an event hosted by the U.S. government considering its inhumane and brutal foreign policy which has continued unchecked for 100 years? I worked for the U.S. government, to be fair, as an employee at the NIH for a summer. I guess I'm a fascist? Do you see how absurd this is? It's a tactic that has been used to deflect attention away from the substance of real issues. For example, let us say the Russian government was behind the DNC hacks (which is an absurd and incredible claim and therefore requires incredible evidence, very litle of which has been substantiated) and then let us put aside how incredibly stupid and dangerous it would be of Putin to directly attack the Masters of the Free World like this. Does that change the substance of what was revealed in the DNC e-mail leak? No, it does not. Again, in a sane country, both claims would be considered side by side and independent of one another. "The Ruskies did it" does not absolve the DNC. 

On this point, the author adds that "there is within the far left of Stein's generation (she’s 66) an idea inherited from the Cold War that holds that to be too critical of Russia is on some level to endorse the presumptions and priorities of the American war machine". I would love to meet a single person that honestly thinks that we shouldn't be critical of Russia because it means endorsing the American war machine. This is an old criticism favored by the McCarthyists to find Soviet "sympathizers" and denounce them as unprincipled hypocrites. Its latest iteration is accusing anyone who suggests that terrorism might have something to do with decades of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East of being a "terrorist sympathizer" or a "jihadi apologist". Here's a more simple and revealing explanation: The U.S. should take responsibility for primarily its own actions. I believe that should be the case, mostly because it makes perfect sense that it should be the case. This is why when the U.S. accuses Russia of interfering with our national elections, I laugh. Not only because it is mostly unsubstantiated propaganda, not because I love Putin, but because the [U.S. interferes with the national elections of other countries all of the time](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.html) and doesn't even try to hide it. Sometimes they try and fail to decide the outcome of another nation's elections and when they don't get their way, they just invade the country and [punish the population](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/paul-farmer/who-removed-aristide) for having the audacity to vote the wrong way. If you think those are all just wild, left-wing conspiracy theories then check out this short report from the right-wing [Cato Institute](http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa058.html) (1985) explaining precisely why the majority of the international community thinks the [U.S. is the greatest threat to world peace](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/greatest-threat-world-peace-country_n_4531824.html) (<- Link to media reporting, primary source: WiN/Gallup poll [here](http://www.wingia.com/en/services/about_the_end_of_year_survey/global_results/7/33/)) and has a tendency of supporting brutal dictatorships. The Cato Analysis is too benign, in my opinion, since it is now understood that the [U.S. government understands precisely how our actions in the Middle East lead to terrorism (and has for years) and nevertheless chose to continue the course anyway](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/secret-pentagon-report-reveals-west-saw-isis-as-strategic-asset-b99ad7a29092#.su2vgcs53). This is why when the mass-murdering, autocratic Rodrigo Duterte is criticized by the U.S. government for carrying out a cruel and brutal extrajudicial killing campaign, I laugh. Not because I like Rodrigo Duterte (he's a [bloodthirsty lunatic](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-hitler-idUSKCN1200B9)), but because the U.S. has an institutionalized extrajudicial killing campaign in the drone program which goes virtually unchallenged by anyone in the government. Again, in a sane country, we would tell our leaders to stop committing crimes before it accused other states of being criminal themselves. Or, in the words of Noam Chomsky, the best way to fight international terrorism is to stop participating in it. 

At this point, it should be mentioned that it is Hillary Clinton who is the physical and political embodiment of U.S. foreign policy. I'm sure she has sat at the same table as Vladimir Putin many times (not that anyone should care about that) but what is more concerning to me is her [unapologetic](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.html) [embrace of Henry Kissinger](https://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/) (there are two links there, one to her discussing the U.S role in the Honduras coup of 2009, citing Kissinger, and another to her describing Kissinger as a friend and mentor). If Jill Stein GOING TO MOSCOW to SIT AT THE SAME TABLE AS PUTIN (*gasp*) is a problem, then HRC saying she learned everything she knows from a mass-murderer and war criminal should be enough to make voting for Clinton completely unconscionable. Luckily, the author has an out for themselves:

>A vote is not for a person. A vote is cast for a coalition of forces and interests that have a realistic chance of moving the country and world in the direction you prefer, even when the candidate is imperfect. If you make yourself a part of that coalition, you can be a part of a movement that can influence the imperfect candidate in a better direction.

After a couple of paragraphs of what essentially amounted to a character assassination designed to paint third party voters as 'unprincipled' (remember, you are not unprincipled if you vote for Clinton in spite of her terrible human rights record in the State department, you are 'pragmatic' precisely because you are not expected to have 'principles') the author claims that a "vote is not for a person" but for a "coalition of forces" and joining that coalition allows you to "influence the imperfect candidate in a better direction". The operative phrase in this quote is, of course, "a realistic chance..." because the rest of the statement could just as easily apply to Stein and Johnson, and even Trump. The candidates are imperfect so we, uh, buy them a book and they can learn what Aleppo is, or something like that. First of all, this argument is nonsense. No one would make the argument that we should all vote for Trump because he doesn't have Hillary's terrible human rights record and because he is an idiot we can "become part of a coalition" to push him "in the direction we prefer". This argument is materially identical to the oft-repeated "you don't vote for a person, you vote to produce outcomes". The problem with arguments like these is that they have nothing to do with how change, much less 'progress', actually happens in this country. 

Well, does it happen as a result of voting? [Yah, probably not](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf).

This 2014 Princeston study demonstrates that the chance a policy is adopted has nothing to do with public opinion. In other words, a policy is just as likely to be adopted if no one supports it as it is if everyone supports it. Unless you are part of the economic elite, your opinion on policy is likely of no consequence. The study is worth reading in full, so I won't go over all of it but the highlights: their model most likely underestimates the influence of economic elites, for reasons they list; the political preferences of elites have some correlation with that of the larger public but the preferences of interest groups (especially those defined as "business" interests groups) actually have a negative correlation with public preferences. Of course, if you are an average person in the U.S. you didn't need a Princeton study to understand this is the way our political system works; strictly for the donor, capitalist, and lobbyist classes and not for its people. 

How does change happen? Not by voting for the Democratic party at every opportunity, certainly. Change happens through popular struggle and mass organization. When people press their demands and make a policy untenable by the ruling class, that is how change happens in our society. That is the 40 hour work week, end of child labor, women's suffrage, the end of segregation, the end of chattel slavery, the minimum wage, etc. There is plenty of evidence to substantiate this claim, all of it you can see for yourself if you bother to look. Change does not happen because the "right" people are in the Supreme Court (progressive decisions have been made by Republican and Democrat appointments and vice versa for regressive decisions). Until such a time as the structure of our political system changes radically to actually be democratic and accountable to the public will, that is the way it will be. It is not that Clinton and Trump "are the same", it is that the power structures which determine the actions and policies of the State will not change merely by voting for one of the two major parties whose survival depends on those power structures. 

That is the principle behind voting for a third party. So, if voting for a third party is to be deemed "unprincipled" then it should be on those grounds that the argument is leveled. While we're on the subject of principles, let's stop pretending that voting for HRC has anything to do with principles, because it doesn't. She is "the most qualified candidate in history" on paper but the substance of her actual record is terrible - full stop. It's fine to talk about Hillary as the "lesser of two evils" and cite pragmatism (although, as I explained, that 'pragmatism' won't lead to positive change) as the reason behind your vote, but if we start talking about Clinton actually being a "good" candidate with a "stellar record" then we have descended into the realm of the absurd. Out of that absurd realm we get articles claiming [the only reason anyone dislikes Clinton is because she is a woman](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/stop-pretending-you-dont-_b_12191766.html), or that she is, in fact, [not evil at all](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/22/opinions/clinton-lesser-two-evils-obeidallah/). 

Why is it so important to break out of the two-party system? Well, aside from all of the reasons I already listed (and many others), it is because the two party system allows consensus politics to dictate the scope of the political imagination in the United States. But that is a topic for another day.
