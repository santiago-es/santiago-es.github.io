title: strike!

Over twelve hundred Tufts nurses went on strike this past weekend in the first nursing strike in Boston in over thirty years; it is the largest nursing strike in the history of the state. The Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA, a nursing union) and Tufts Medical Center spent more than a full year at the collective bargaining table before Tufts nurses finally voted to strike. [The core issues in dispute according to the MNA are](https://www.massnurses.org/news-and-events/p/openItem/10555): 
> The need for improved nurse staffing with safer patient assignments for nurses throughout the hospital
> The need for more IV nurses and clinical resource nurses
> The need to have charge nurses who are free of patient assignments at the start of all shifts, in all units. A charge nurse is an RN who is responsible for managing all aspects of nursing responsibilities during each shift, from processing patients in and out to delegating nursing rounds. Being free of an initial patient assignment will allow Tufts’ charge nurses to provide desperately needed support to patients and nurses at the busiest time (i.e., change of shift)
> The need for wage improvements that will make the hospital market competitive, thereby improving nurse recruitment and retention
> The need for pension protections/improvements that will make the hospital market competitive

After a year of negotiations, both sides have made concessions and [while Tufts Medical Center has agreed to raise wages for its nurses (by 5.5-10.5%)](https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/-/media/Brochures/TuftsMC/TUFTS%20MC%20Negotiations/10864%20MNA%20handout_Proposal%20Summary_062717-3.ashx) the pension and insurance plan proposed by management requires nurses to dedicate a larger proportion of their own income to paying (an additional 3% of that income) into their HMO plan and towards a new direct contribution pension fund scheme. The hospital rejected the union's proposal to enroll Tufts nurses into a union-controlled multi-employer direct benefit plan. It appears that disagreements over the pension plan as well as the management's refusal to budge on what nurses consider critical staffing and scheduling issues ultimately led Tufts nurses to strike.

Healthcare strikes are rare, as far as strikes go. Healthcare workers - and nurses in particular - genuinely care about their patients and the instinct to put the patient before one's self is real and strong, to the extent that healthcare workers often appear to neglect their own health and safety. Not only that, the delivery of quality, compassionate care requires not only years of training, but experience, knowledge of your patients' particular needs and conditions, as well as rapport and trust within the healthcare team (therefore replacing a provider is a thorny ordeal). It is for these reasons, among others, that this one-day strike comes after a full year of negotiation. [It is also for these very same reasons that, last year, 3,300 Brigham and Women's nurses called off a strike merely hours before it was scheduled to take place after the union and management teams reached a last-minute agreement. The Brigham had already spent 24 million dollars in preparation for the work stoppage](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/08/12/brigham-takes-million-hit-from-strike-preparations/SiJerQDQhdREtNAVBMBOlK/story.html). One sign on the picket line summed it up: "If we're *out here*, there's something wrong *in there*."

The strike is in itself a major development, and deserves attention if you have not been paying attention to it, and we owe those nurses our solidarity for undertaking what must have been an incredibly difficult and bitter decision in order to improve their own lot as workers and the lot of their patients. That being said, the Tufts strike, the all-but-materialized Brigham strike, and the [12,000 strong Minnesota nursing strike](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127741725) of 2010 (the largest of its kind in U.S history) are symptoms of  critical faults lurking below the surface of our healthcare infrastructure.

# "No Margin: No Mission"

[Tufts Medical Center openly admits](https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/-/media/Brochures/TuftsMC/About%20Us/DB%20Slide%20Deck%20December%205%202016.ashx) that the decisions which precipitated the nursing strike and informed its bargaining in the year preceding it are centered around the financial health of the hospital. This is not surprising given that even nonprofit hospitals are, ostensibly, run for profit (that is, they must demonstrate the ability to produce positive margins) if for no other reason than to maintain a good credit rating and keep the cost of capital low (a cost which has been increasing steadily in the healthcare sector as newer, more expensive technologies become the standard of care). In a capitalist society, the old adage of the business world holds as true for hospitals as it does for lemonade stands and oil companies. No margin: no mission. 

While it is true that [some hospitals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/02/these-hospitals-make-the-most-money-off-patients-and-theyre-mostly-nonprofits/?utm_term=.6e88a0546148) (and, certainly, all hospital executives) are still making handsome profits, hospital profitability is falling. In September of 2016 the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) made the [following anemic forecast](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51920): 

>   If the hospitals we examined were able to improve their productivity in line with productivity growth in the economy as a whole—by about 0.8 percent per year, on average, through 2025, according to CBO’s estimate—then the share of them with negative profit margins would increase to 41 percent in 2025 [up from 27% in 2016], and their average profit margin would fall to 3.3 percent.
>   If, instead, those hospitals were able to improve their  productivity by 0.4 percent per year, the share of them with negative profit margins would increase to 51 percent in 2025, and their average profit margin would fall to 1.6 percent.
>   If those hospitals were unable to increase their productivity (or to reduce cost growth in some other way), then the share of them with negative profit margins would increase to 60 percent in 2025, and their average profit margin would fall to negative 0.2 percent.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) made a [similar projection](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/ACAmarginsimulations2015.pdf) in 2015:

> By 2019, up to 5 percent more hospitals would experience negative total facility margins, and approximately 15 percent more would experience negative Medicare margins. 

> By 2040, approximately half of hospitals, 70 percent of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs),and 90 percent of home health agencies (HHAs) would have negative total facility margins. 

It's worth noting that [hospital operating margins](http://www.aha.org/research/reports/tw/chartbook/2016/table4-1.pdf) have been fairly stable and increasing modestly over the past 20 years.

So why are the CMS and CBO so pessimistic? Well, the answer is that hospitals have found ways to cut costs and raise revenue in order to protect their already narrow profit margins.   

# Cutting Costs and Raising Revenue

Certainly, cutting pension funds is one way to reduce costs, but  so is downsizing. In recent years, hospitals have bought out thousands of employee contracts in an effort to "do more with less" and safeguard their bottom line. The very same Brigham and Women's hospital which narrowly avoided a nursing strike in 2016  [announced in April of this year](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/28/brigham-hospital-layoffs/) that it would buyout 1,600 employee contracts in a move that represents a 9% reduction in its total workforce. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (the fourth largest hospital in the country) did the same for [3,500 of its employees](http://triblive.com/business/headlines/8442119-74/upmc-health-largest) in 2015 (5.6% of its total workforce). 

Hospital system mergers and acquisitions are [likewise on the rise](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/03/rising-costs-changing-payments-driving-hospital-mergers/IVT1Cawxax0jxQxfAGN5UL/story.html). Not only that but the number of yearly hospital mergers and hospital system acquisitions has [doubled in the past decade](http://www.aha.org/research/reports/tw/chartbook/2016/chart2-9.pdf). The two most important factors driving hospital revenue are patient volume and payer mix (the combination of private, public, and non-payers which the hospital charges for its expenses) and for large hospitals acquiring smaller or struggling hospitals is an easy way to improve both. During this same time period hospitals have bought out more and more private practices from physicians and physician groups, an [event typically accompanied by higher prices at those practices](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/upshot/medicare-proposal-would-even-out-doctors-pay.html). As hospital systems become larger and more consolidated it is possible to coordinate care and referrals between primary, acute, tertiary, and specialty providers more cheaply than before, but the underlying reality is that hospitals are run to maximize profit for shareholders, not to improve general health and well-being. As a result, consolidated hospital systems will use their vice grip over the local market as leverage to squeeze higher payouts from insurers in that area, [a cost that is passed on to us in the form of higher premiums.](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/everywhere-hospitals-are-merging-but-why-should-you-care-201504017844) It goes without saying that the logical conclusion of this corporate crunch is not only incredibly uneven healthcare costs throughout the country (the same surgery can differ in price from one hospital, county, state to another) but rising overall costs for an already bloated healthcare system. 

![Prices vary widely even within the same market](http://i.imgur.com/uaZ99BV.png)

In spite of an aggressive, multi-directional push to bring down costs and raise revenue, hospital system profits remain marginal and stable, merely resisting the tendency to fall even further, as experts have projected they will. We can expect, therefore, more pressure to come down on health workers as executives and managers do everything they can to salvage their sinking ships: cutting pensions, laying off workers, trimming back benefits, and asking for longer and more numerous shifts. Wherever health workers are well organized, we can expect more resistance to these measures and perhaps, wherever negotiations fail, more strikes. 

# A Crisis of Direction

The more immediate crisis facing American health care is a crisis of direction. Namely, nobody knows where the health care system is going and all of the options on the table lead to disaster. On the one hand, the Affordable Care Act faces a total repeal, years before it could be fully implemented (most importantly, years before the fee-for-service model could be replaced), and the proposals thus far by the ruling party are nothing short of [barbaric](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/339653-the-senate-gop-health-plan-is-the-next-man-made-disaster). On the other hand, the Affordable Care Act itself did little in the ways of repairing the deeper, structural issues with our healthcare system. Its varied and disjointed attempts at creating new healthcare delivery mechanisms (bundled care, incentives for primary care providers, disincentives for readmissions and high rates of hospital-acquired conditions) were [implemented unevenly across the country; in some places, not at all](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr1503614?af=R&rss=currentIssue#t=article). More importantly, it left the private insurers untouched, themselves responsible for uneven and sky-high costs across the country, while giving them a new influx of customers (through the individual mandate and by taking away their ability to deny coverage to patients with many pre-existing conditions). 

This mistake might prove fatal for the law given that it is responsible for the recent [flight of insurers](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/why-so-many-insurers-are-leaving-obamacare/526137/) from healthcare exchanges all over the country. 

>Though some insurers are still deciding whether to participate in the Obamacare exchanges, the complaint about lackluster insurer participation is valid. In recent weeks alone, Aetna pulled out of Virginia’s Obamacare exchange, leaving its participation in Obamacare this year limited to just four states. Medica, the last insurer remaining in most of Iowa, threatened to stop selling individual plans. And after Humana pulled out of Tennessee in February, leaving 40,000 people with no insurance option, BlueCross BlueShield reluctantly stepped in on Tuesday, but only if certain conditions are met. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, 31 percent of counties will have just one insurer this year, up from just 7 percent last year.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats remain reticent to consider the most robust and popular healthcare model in the industrialized world: single-payer, government-funded care. This article from the Intercept [is worth a read](https://theintercept.com/2017/07/01/dick-gephardt-single-payer-health-insurance-lobbyists/):

>ACTIVISTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY have provided real momentum to the idea of a single-payer health care system, pressing the issue in California and among leading figures in the Democratic Party.

>The mere prospect of single payer, however, has elicited swift derision from some corners of the party, with Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic House minority leader, laughing off the idea at a health insurance conference earlier this month.

>“Not in my lifetime,” scoffed Gephardt, when asked if the United States will ever adopt such a system.

>Gephardt, who serves as a Democratic “superdelegate” responsible for choosing the party’s presidential nominee, was asked about the possibility of single payer at the Centene Corporation annual investor day conference at The Pierre, a ritzy five-star hotel in New York City.

>Centene, which merged with Health Net two years ago, is a health insurance company that sells coverage in 28 states. At the conference, which included investors and Centene executives as well as lobbyists, an unidentified participant asked Gephardt about whether the industry should fear being replaced by a single-payer-style system. Such a move, the questioner remarked, would present an “existential threat.”

Washington resistance to single-payer comes in spite of the fact that the United States ["competes with Cuba and Costa Rica on quality"] (http://catalyst.nejm.org/make-crazy-expensive-amazing-uneven-health-care-system-better-faster/)(two countries with 'socialized' healthcare models and whose combined GDP is 0.77% of US GDP; "The United States comes in 37th on international comparisons of quality, just behind Cuba and ahead of Costa Rica.").

Public opinion in the U.S. has shifted slowly over time to supporting a single-payer system - or something like it - but the "public option" remains a marginalized alternative in the U.S. healthcare debate; admittedly, popularity for the public option has rebounded in the aftermath of the Sanders campaign which brought 'Medicare for All' into mainstream politics. This is unsurprising, given that public support for or against any given policy [has nothing to do with whether or not that policy will be adopted](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf). The takeaway here is not that there is nothing ordinary people can do about the way society is run, rather, it is that ideas are not in and of themselves agents of change. The real motive force behind change is organized action, the gathering of a superior correlation of forces to apply pressure in some direction. So it has been for [the eight-hour workday](https://www.iww.org/history/library/misc/origins_of_mayday), [the emancipation of American slaves](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/10/why_historians_are_reluctant_to_call_the_american_civil_war_a_slave_rebellion.html), [LGBT+ rights](http://isreview.org/issue/63/stonewall-birth-gay-power), and many more of the social leaps of the last century. 

We should consider the struggle for a better, more equitable, affordable, and accessible healthcare system in the same breath as these other movements. Access to healthcare does not only have immediate and long-term implications for human survival, but our healthcare institutions are related to, if not directly implicated in, deeper problems within our society. Biological experimentation on marginalized persons is an unavoidable yet frequently ignored cornerstone of modern medicine: from [slaves](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932714200202) to [members of the black community in the modern day](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932714200202); from testing [biological weapons](http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/16/bib/980816.rv133152.html) and [pharmaceutical products](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550121/pdf/13181_2009_Article_BF03161037.pdf) on prisoners (before the 1970s, 90% of pharmaceutical products were tested on prisoners; the practice is diminished but continues today in America, the only country in the world where the practice remains commonplace after the adoption of the Nuremburg code). Access to adequate care has been systematically segregated along class and racial lines, leading to deep resentment and mistrust of what should be a celebrated institution. The most [conservative estimates](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:336964/fulltext.pdf) place 18 to 25 percent of bankruptcies as having medical bills or payments as their primary cause. The battle for access to abortion and contraceptive care contends not only with  fundamental issues of bodily autonomy, but [life and death](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding). Transgender persons depend on, and are routinely barred from receiving, [healthcare resources and procedures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3953767/).

There can therefore be no talk of reparations for marginalized people that does not contain preferential access to quality care, no talk of prison reform (or abolition) that does not contend with the perverse incentives of pharmaceutical capital, etc. We must always remember that beyond a lot of technicalities and wonkish handwringing, the question of what kind of healthcare system we must build is an urgent one for all of us. 
 
# Imagining a Different System

Many institutions have given us a glimpse of a way forward. In Austin, Texas, the [People's Community Clinic](https://www.austinpcc.org/about-us/) started out as a small volunteer organization run out of a church basement. Now it operates out of a large, fully equipped primary care facility and its budget of over 8 million dollars serves 11,000 uninsured, low-income, student, and part-time workers. Over half of its executive board is, as its charter demands, always composed of patients at the very same clinic, and all board members are part of the Austin community. At the same clinic patients can receive pro bono legal consultation for worker's comp, tenant, and familial disputes. Patients can sign up for nutrition and cooking classes held in professional kitchens at the clinic where they not only learn how to cook nutritious meals but receive enough ingredients (gratis) at the end of each lesson to cook the same meal for their entire family. While the clinic cannot provide acute or complex care, it represents a proven model for how to provide holistic primary care services to the people who need it the most. 

The [Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199707313370521#t=article) is another example, this time of an ambitious organization that sought to enroll anyone, regardless of condition, in a cooperative system of healthcare providers which could care for the severely disabled and the chronically ill who were turned away by private insurers and practices. In spite of organized resistance from local private interests, the group continued to do so, at one point serving nearly 700,000 patients. The group was eventually bought out by Kaiser Permanente for one billion dollars (in 2017) and as it grew ran head-first into the challenges facing any large firm running an incredibly expensive business in a highly competitive market, but trying all the while to preserve its ideals as a community organization serving its patients first. 

Finally, of course, there are the numerous examples of far more efficient, higher quality systems instituted in places like the U.K., Cuba, France, Japan, Denmark, and elsewhere. It could be the case (in fact, more likely than not) that the right system for the U.S. is not identical to those of Europe and Latin America, but it should be clear that a system based on maximizing shareholder profit instead of meeting human needs is doomed to fail.

No matter what the way forward is to be, it is obvious that those in Congress are not willing to make the changes that are necessary to salvage our healthcare system for the benefit of the public, choosing instead to salvage it for capital and its allies. In the interim, it is right and necessary to support the actions of workers who, like the Tufts nurses, want to improve their lot and the lot of their patients. We should try to look at events such as these not as isolated incidents but as symptoms of a deeper, more critical problem which will require an ambitious program to remedy. There are more topics to cover here -- in particular, why and how physicians are often absent from, if not directly adversarial to, radical changes to our healthcare system and how transformation of our healthcare system necessitates a transformation in how we train our healthcare providers -- but this post is long enough as it is.
