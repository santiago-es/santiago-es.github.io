A [viral video](https://zdoggmd.com/moral-injury/?fbclid=IwAR2-oe0JSmxbZGGVcOagmlNptIvaV_JbjDUYFm7RiuPG9xUWsFm7u3xX3Dk) by physician blogger ZDogg is making the rounds in medical circles reiterating an [earlier call](https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/26/physicians-not-burning-out-they-are-suffering-moral-injury/) to action by Simon Talbot and Wendy Dean – also physicians, a surgeon and psychiatrist, respectively – to reclassify *burnout* in healthcare workers as *moral injury*. 

Talbot and Dean make their case:

>Burnout is a constellation of symptoms that include exhaustion, cynicism, and decreased productivity. More than half of physicians report at least one of these. But the concept of burnout resonates poorly with physicians: it suggests a failure of resourcefulness and resilience, traits that most physicians have finely honed during decades of intense training and demanding work. Even at the Mayo Clinic, which has been tracking, investigating, and addressing burnout for more than a decade, one-third of physicians report its symptoms.

>We believe that burnout is itself a symptom of something larger: our broken health care system. The increasingly complex web of providers’ highly conflicted allegiances — to patients, to self, and to employers — and its attendant moral injury may be driving the health care ecosystem to a tipping point and causing the collapse of resilience.

The concept of *moral injury* entered the psychological vocabulary first through the treatment of Vietnam veterans, and is outlined exhaustively by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shay in his book, *Achilles in Vietnam*, a philosophical meditation on reading the *Iliad* through a modern psyschological lens.

The term is deliberately imprecise, but for what it's worth Shay defines it as all three of the following things ocurring simultaneously:

• A betrayal of what’s right.
• by someone who holds legitimate authority (e.g., in the military—a leader).
• in a high stakes situation.

In other words, a subversion or perversion of trust which results in one participating in, witnessing, or becoming a victim of an action which is antithetical to their core humanity: betrays trust in others and themselves, their code of ethics, their foundation of what is right and wrong.

Talbot and Dean explicitly put the term in context:

>The moral injury of healthcare is not the offense of killing another human in the context of war. It is being unable to provide high-quality care and healing in the context of health care.

I was immediately reminded of Richard Gunderman (another physician) writing in the *Atlantic* about the root cause of [burnout in physicians](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/for-the-young-doctor-about-to-burn-out/284005/):

>Burnout at its deepest level is not the result of some train wreck of examinations, long call shifts, or poor clinical evaluations. It is the sum total of hundreds and thousands of tiny betrayals of purpose, each one so minute that it hardly attracts notice. When a great ship steams across the ocean, even tiny ripples can accumulate over time, precipitating a dramatic shift in course. There are many Tertius Lydgates, male and female, inhabiting the lecture halls, laboratories, and clinics of today’s medical schools. Like latter-day Lydgates, many of them eventually find themselves expressing amazement and disgust at how far they have veered from their primary purpose.

Here's Talbot and Dean reiterating a similar idea:

>Navigating an ethical path among such intensely competing drivers is emotionally and morally exhausting. Continually being caught between the Hippocratic oath, a decade of training, and the realities of making a profit from people at their sickest and most vulnerable is an untenable and unreasonable demand. Routinely experiencing the suffering, anguish, and loss of being unable to deliver the care that patients need is deeply painful. These routine, incessant betrayals of patient care and trust are examples of “death by a thousand cuts.” Any one of them, delivered alone, might heal. But repeated on a daily basis, they coalesce into the moral injury of health care.

I read Gunderman's article for the first time as a sophomore and the concept of burnout among healthcare workers is one I return to quite often in my head. Firstly, because I know so many people working in healthcare and, as a result, am personally aware beyond the shocking statistics how depressingly prevalent depersonalization, exhaustion, cynicism, depression and even suicide are among them. Like Talbot, Dean, and ZDogg I think that the easy and buzzword-laden solutions often bundled under the 'wellness and mindfulness' umbrellas are probably bullshit. Ya, it's really important to take care of yourself but the breadth and depth of this problem in U.S. healthcare suggest that just treating the symptoms can't address the root cause. Up to this point, I think everyone is in agreement but go just beyond it – what is the root cause and how do we address it? – and things get a bit murkier.

E.g., here are Talbot and Dean suggesting some system-level changes which seem to me at least neutral to generally positive.

>What we need is leadership willing to acknowledge the human costs and moral injury of multiple competing allegiances. We need leadership that has the courage to confront and minimize those competing demands. Physicians must be treated with respect, autonomy, and the authority to make rational, safe, evidence-based, and financially responsible decisions. Top-down authoritarian mandates on medical practice are degrading and ultimately ineffective. We need leaders who recognize that caring for their physicians results in thoughtful, compassionate care for patients, which ultimately is good business. Senior doctors whose knowledge and skills transcend the next business cycle should be treated with loyalty and not as a replaceable, depreciating asset. We also need patients to ask what is best for their care and then to demand that their insurer or hospital or health care system provide it — the digital mammogram, the experienced surgeon, the timely transfer, the visit without the distraction of the electronic health record — without the best interest of the business entity (insurer, hospital, health care system, or physician) overriding what is best for the patient.

autonomy for healthcare workers, evidence-based and rational decision making with patient's best interest in mind, systems organized around patient care and not profit – all good things in my book. But then they end the article by saying:

>A truly free market of insurers and providers, one without financial obligations being pushed to providers, would allow for self-regulation and patient-driven care. These goals should be aimed at creating a win-win where the wellness of patients correlates with the wellness of providers. In this way we can avoid the ongoing moral injury associated with the business of health care.

Throughout the rest of this post I will argue that this is the opposite of what we ought to do. I've written a few blog posts on elements of the healthcare system. To summarize my explicit position ([No Margin is the Mission](http://santiago-es.github.io/tufts-nurse-strike/)): There can be no equitable and just healthcare system run for profit, there can be no equitable and just healthcare system in which private insurance companies are allowed to exist. Why? To put it simply, because unlike Talbot and Dean I don't think it's possible to reconcile the competing interests of the patient, workers, and corporate entities which together organize the foundation of how healthcare is delivered in this country. Each of these interests do not come to the negotiating table as equals, nor are they equally fundamental to the logic of healthcare delivery in the U.S, or even consistent enough in content and form across various parts of the country (perhaps even across hospital systems in the same city) to be spoken of as if they were a single, contiguous, uninterrupted, generic, interchangeable, homogeneous set of conditions. That is not to say that the problem at hand (What are the fundamental conflicts between the interests of the patient, corporate owners, and healthcare workers? How do fix them in order to prevent injury to the workers and provide the best possible care for the patients?) is ineffable, but there are angles of it which I think are underilluminated. I'm encouraged that there has been a resurgence of concern for the wellbeing in the workplace, but here I'll try to spin the conversation in a different direction to try to work through a few ideas which have rattled around in my head for some time. It might seem like a circuitous detour, but I'll circle around to burnout and moral injury. 

Our healthcare system is run for-profit, meaning that the only way for any entity delivering healthcare to continue existing is to generate more in revenue than it costs to deliver their services. How are elements of "care" priced? Relative value units (RVUs) which are themselves a [function](http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medicaleconomics/
content/tags/calculating-relative-value-units/rvus-valuable-tool-aidingpractice-
m?page=full.) of physician's work (weighted at 53%), practice expenses (44%), and malpractice insurance (3%). The costs associated with specialized labor, malpractice risk, and support staff, equipment needed to perform a procedure are the reason that something like getting your wisdom teeth removed is typically more expensive than being prescribed medication, even if the medication does more for your overall health. RVUs are set by CMS (that is, the Federal Govt.) and were originally created to reign in out-of-control healthcare spending and large disparities in the cost of services. The inroduction of uniform Medicare and Medicaid paylines for healthcare services may have achieved that to an extent, but that is not to say that healthcare costs in the country are even because pricing is only one part of a much larger equation and CMS is the largest but not the only payer in the market. The fact that many patients are able to pay but providers must find some way to foot the cost of their care is another. [Utilization is another still](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum). 

Here's Atul Gawande writing in the *New Yorker* in 2009 about McAllen, TX, a town which has the second-highest healthcare spending per capita in the U.S.:

>The Medicare payment data provided the most detail. Between 2001 and 2005, critically ill Medicare patients received almost fifty per cent more specialist visits in McAllen than in El Paso, and were two-thirds more likely to see ten or more specialists in a six-month period. In 2005 and 2006, patients in McAllen received twenty per cent more abdominal ultrasounds, thirty per cent more bone-density studies, sixty per cent more stress tests with echocardiography, two hundred per cent more nerve-conduction studies to diagnose carpal-tunnel syndrome, and five hundred and fifty per cent more urine-flow studies to diagnose prostate troubles. They received one-fifth to two-thirds more gallbladder operations, knee replacements, breast biopsies, and bladder scopes. They also received two to three times as many pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, cardiac-bypass operations, carotid endarterectomies, and coronary-artery stents. And Medicare paid for five times as many home-nurse visits. The primary cause of McAllen’s extreme costs was, very simply, the across-the-board overuse of medicine.

>Two economists working at Dartmouth, Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra, found that the more money Medicare spent per person in a given state the lower that state’s quality ranking tended to be. In fact, the four states with the highest levels of spending—Louisiana, Texas, California, and Florida—were near the bottom of the national rankings on the quality of patient care.

All the while, elsewhere in the article, Gawande explains that the people of McAllen, TX are not especially sick when compared to any other corner of the country. Add onto this [uneven spending and pricing on drugs all over the country](http://santiago-es.github.io/drugs/), the fact that physician services are far more expensive in some parts of the country than others, and you begin to approximate the full, jagged picture. It would be too much of a project, and far out from my wheelhouse, to speculate as to why providers in some areas over-utilize care and others don't, but suffice it to say that most practicing physicians and hospital systems in the country are incentivized to over-utilize care. The fee-for-service model of care (of which the Medicare RVU system is only one, specialized instance of, albeit Medicare is the largest payer in the U.S.; reimbursement rates from private providers are often negotiated on a case-by-case or insurance plan-by-plan basis between providers, hospitals, and insurance companies) has engendered a perverse alignment of incentives which has, in my opinion, affected every relationship within our healthcare ecosystem: provider and patient, provider and employer, mentor and trainee, healthcare organizations and their communities.

There is a second, newer, and growingly important level to this discussion: patient data. Since the advent of electronic health records, patient data has quickly become a valuable commodity in the healthcare marketplace. This space has matured at a breakneck pace with [countless startups and firms](https://hbr.org/2017/06/to-survive-health-care-data-providers-need-to-stop-selling-data) dedicated strictly to creating products and services from this data appearing all over the country. Even boutique companies which are not directly embedded in the healthcare space are finding ways to extract profit from the insatiable demand for more and more detailed datasets. No kind of data is more valuable than quality genetic data, and companies like 23andMe have developed fairly ingenious ways of amassing this commodity by taking ownership of something most people probably never considered had much value to begin with (indeed, the main profit center and competitive advantage of 23andMe are its vast stores of genetic and demographic information not the sale of its genealogy kits to the public). This booming new sector of healthcare information technology (HCIT) has appeared and grown to saturation in the blink of an eye before anyone had time to consider the question of who should own the *patient's* data anyway and by now the sums of money involved are far too large for HCIT CEOs to retroactively consider the irony in having to ask the question to begin with. The apostrophe, once uttered, gives away the game.

Things are changing somewhat, however. Here's L.E.K Consulting writing about the transforming value of patient data in the wake of policy changes at the CMS in the [*Harvard Business Review*](https://hbr.org/2017/06/to-survive-health-care-data-providers-need-to-stop-selling-data) in 2017:

>Yet too many HCIT providers are still pursuing that data-centric advantage. The bulk of HCIT investment supports startups that sell data — clinical or operational information that is otherwise difficult for clients to obtain or to organize. These firms regard data as the source of business value. But as more data and more data providers flood the market, a competitive position based solely on data becomes impossible to defend. Consider the move by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to publish extensive Medicare enrollment and utilization data, and to make it accessible and easy to interpret via the CMS website. Information that would once have been proprietary — and premium-priced — is now widely available, for free. CMS’s move illustrates a broad trend. Increasingly, for most HCIT firms, data is a commodity.

This is all to say that the technological revolution in modern medicine which begun towards the end of the twentieth century and continues at full pace today has led to the intensification of contradictions in the American healthcare system which have always been present. [Hospital profit margins have never been thinner](http://santiago-es.github.io/tufts-nurse-strike/) but CEO and administrator salaries have [never been higher](https://www.athenahealth.com/insight/expert-forum-rise-and-rise-healthcare-administrator), our ability to intervene in the course of disease has never been greater or more complex but physicians are spending less and less time with their patients, etc. etc. etc. 


<img src="https://www.athenahealth.com/insight/sites/insight/files/Chart.jpg" alt=" " width="700"/>

My argument is that at the core of those contradictions is the commodification of the patient. The transformation of the patient, the object of a provider's labor and indeed the *raison d'etre* for their entire profession, in the logic of our healthcare machinery into a bottomless store of exploitable material ripe for the extraction of profit is the core problem of burnout in healthcare workers. It is not the only problem, but is, I believe, an urgent one deserving more thought and energy on the part of not only providers, politicians, businessmen, but our civil society as a whole. 

That many patient's are ungrateful, abusive even, is true. That medical training is brutal, long, expensive, and in many ways completely unreasonable is true. That doctors, nurses, techs, and administrators are often at each other's throats is true. But, the terms of those conflicts have been explored time and time again and the conflicts themselves are as old as modern Medicine itself. The strongest evidence of this fact is that the litanies of the *the House of God* continue to be religiously read and recited even though the structure of medical training and medicine itself have radically changed since Shem's novel was first published four decades ago.


<img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh3jefuRmj1qajc4eo1_1280.png" alt="Laws of the House of God by Samuel Shem" width="700"/>

These conflicts are not unimportant contributors to burnout, moral injury in healthcare workers. Indeed, they are somewhat unviersally felt by healthcare providers all over the world regardless of the political economy of their healthcare system or time period. The work is hard. 

But the commodification of the patient is, in my opinion, an under-appreciated factor in this bigger problem. The relationship between the commodification of the patient and burnout becomes more obvious if we call burnout what I think it is: alienation. 

The alienation of the provider from the object of their labor – that is, the patient – from themselves, from their profession, and finally from humanity as a whole as a result of thousands of minute, imperceptible betrayals of purpose, the accumulation of moral injuries which are then ignored, one too many unconscious sacrifices of the conscience. People are resilient and they can adapt, they can look for better working conditions or find a way to work for themselves, they can leave for greener pastures, or they can find just enough ways to cope to stay healthy one week to the next, but no one is unaffected. When Marx first wrote about alienation and estrangement he had the indsutrial worker in mind – a meaty cog, a turner of the screw, a lever, a man staring into a machine and seeing his own reflection – but its physical manifestation remains the same two hundred years in the future: "the mortification of the body and the ruination of the mind", the satisfaction of physical needs as "sole and ultimate ends" as a final defensive response to their apparently terminal condition (Marx, *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*). In *House of God*, sex is the outlet the characters use to get through the day, trapped as they are in absurd, inescapable, endless, and increasingly meaningless work. Their real-life counterparts often turn to substance abuse to ease the pain or, as is unfortunately common, to end it. Injured and estranged physicians appear in the cultural imagination from the outset of the profession whether it is Thomas Browne writing about his struggle to reconcile his Christian faith with medical science (*Religio Medici*, 1643), Tertius Lydgate's exchange of idealism for money, chicks, power, and chicks (*Middlemarch*, 1871), Roy Basch's traumatic internship which has him abandon internal medicine for psychiatry (*The House of God*, 1978), or real-life accounts of leaving medicine in order to save one's own life (*This is Going to Hurt*, 2017). At the same time, it is the capacity of the healthcare worker to improve lives, to be an expert in a time of need, to do something positive and useful for others which continues to draw people to the profession, often inspired by a meaningful and personal encounter with a patient, with disease. If moral injury is a betrayal of trust which undermines our sense of self, humanity, of purpose then healthcare workers are at such high risk precisely because the capacity to do meaningful work and form substantial relationships with others, patients among them, is what makes healthcare work worth pursuing. In discussing moral injury, burnout, alienation, what have you, we should keep that fact close at hand. Martha Nussbaum, the author of *the Fragility of Goodness* put it much better than I ever could, I think:

>“To be a good human being is to have a kind of openness to the world, an ability to trust uncertain things beyond your own control, that can lead you to be shattered in very extreme circumstances for which you were not to blame. That says something very important about the condition of the ethical life: that it is based on a trust in the uncertain and on a willingness to be exposed; it’s based on being more like a plant than like a jewel, something rather fragile, but whose very particular beauty is inseparable from that fragility.” 

In any case, I think these are things we should all think about: how do we derive meaning from our work, to what extent should we expect any meaning from it, how can we obtain more freedom in it and from it, what structures are in place which prevent us from doing so or having done so in the first place? In healthcare in particular, how can we return the care of human beings, both workers and patients, to the center of healthcare? There is no shortage of very intelligent, talented people working on the many problems which plague our healthcare system from delivery, access, to cost, technology development, and the training of future professionals. I'm not going to pretend to have any answers. But I do feel strongly that if we want to get serious about tackling the epidemic of depersonalization, depression, alienation, exhaustion in our healthcare workers then we need to consider the core relationships from which both moral fulfillment and injury originate instead of framing healthcare workers as atomized, untouching pieces independent of a larger, dynamic, multifaceted economy. The patient is the most fundamental piece at the bottom of this Byzantine network, can there be a better place to start? 

A few more things. I am sometimes concerned with the privileging of white collar and strictly contemporary workers in discussions on burnout. It is here that I do think the term can prove inadequate. The word *burnout* implies exhaustion, depletion, obliteration, a using up. That someone working in an acute, high-stakes environment for 60+ hours per week could experience burnout is not necessarily surprising, but how could it happen to anyone else? Even Anne Helen Petersen's Buzzfeed (very good and widely read) essay arguing why and how [burnout](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) has become "*the* contemporary condition" focuses on knowledge workers, service workers, people whose lives are both experienced and earned on social media. That is, educated millenials who – whether adequately, under, or unemployed – are in some way involuntarily embedded by their status, upbrinding, and education into an endless cycle of unreasonable expectations, FOMO, ever expanding and uncontainable work which has come to define all aspects of their lives. Her analysis is situated in this particular time, this particular generation. Of course, it's a valuable analysis which is why it resonated with so many of us and was shared like wildfire on social media when it came out in January. My argument is, however, somewhat different in that I will argue that there is nothing special about our generation or time which has given rise to an epidemic of burnout, moral injury, alienation; rather, the same fundamental problem of alienation which once affected strictly the working classes has become more intense and generalized by the very factors Petersen discusses in her essay.

There is something very powerful and insidous about the idea that to labor is moral and good. The journalist Studs Terkel recognized through the effort of compiling a nearly 600 page tome documenting the daily lives of working class Americans in the 70s was able to see work for what it was. Here's Terkel writing in *Working* in 1970:

>This book, being about work, is, by its very nature, about violence – to the spirit as well as to the body. It is about ulcers as well as accidents, about shouting matches as well as fistfights, about nervous breakdowns as well as kicking a dog around. It is, above all (or beneath all), about daily humiliations. To survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us. The scars, psychic as well as physical brought home to the supper table and the TV set, may have touched, malignantly, the soul of our society. More or less ("More or less," that most ambiguous of phrases, pervades many of the conversations that comprise this book, reflecting, perhaps an ambiguity of attitude toward The Job. Something more than Orwellian acceptance, something less than Luddite sabotage. Often the two impulses are fused in the same person.)

>There are, of course, the happy few who find a savor in their daily job: the Indiana stonemason, who looks upon his work and sees that it is good; the Chicago piano tuner, who seeks and finds the sound that delights; the Chicago bookbinder, who saves a piece of history; the Brooklyn fireman, who saves a piece of life...But don't these satisfactions, like Jude's hunger for knowledge, tell us more about the person than about his task? Perhaps. Nonetheless, there is a common attribute here: a meaning to their work well over and beyond the reward of the paycheck. For the many, there is a hardly concealed discontent. The blue-collar blues is no more bitterly sung than the white-collar moan. "I'm a machine," says the spot-welder. "I'm caged," says the bank teller, and echoes the hotel clerk. "I'm a mule" says the steelworker. "A monkey can do what I do," says the receptionist. "I'm less than a farm implement" says the migrant worker. "I'm an object," says the fashion model. Blue and white collar call upon the identical phrase: "I'm a robot."

The message is perhaps more clear in the worker's own words. Here is a 19 year old hospital aide, describing herself and her work which she has been doing for four years.

>I'm a nurse's aid, dumb aid. Makin' beds and bed pans and rotten stuff like that. I really don't know if I mind the work as much as you aways have to work with people, and that drives me nuts. I don't mind emptying the bed pan, what's in it, blood, none of that bothers me at all. Dealing with people is what I don't like. It just makes everything else blah...We get on the floor and you have to weigh people or pass water, and they yell when you get 'em up so early in the morning. Then they don't want to get out of bed when you weigh 'em. They complain...I work on a floor that's geriatric. Old people and psychiatric, so there's never anyone in their right minds. They're out of it or they're confused. After you pass out trays, and there's rarely a tray that has everything on it, they start hollering "I didn't get two sugars!" and then you spend half the time running to all the rooms gettin' all their stuff. Then you have to feed all of them, and half the patients are out of it and they spit stuff at you and they throw their food. They throw their dishes on the wall and floor.

Here is a home nurse who worked seven days a week taking care of a 93 year old woman (her "baby"):

>The work don't leave my mind. I have been so long with her that it became part of me. In my mind it's always working: "How's she getting along?" I worry what happened to her between those hours before the night nurse report. If I go off on a trip, I'll be talking about her. I'll say, "I wonder what happened to my baby?" My girlfriend will say, "Which baby are you talking about?" I'll say, "My patient." I went to Las Vegas. I spent a week there. Every night I called. Because if she has these convulsions...

Different, almost opposite experiences and attitudes towards a similar kind of work. It shows that it is difficult to talk about work in wholly generic terms, even in the same line. More importantly, had I not mentioned that these interviews were published in 1970, they could have just as easily come from 2019. In the young aide, there is the humiliation, depersonalization, visible apathy towards human relationships secondary to the experience of aggression and antipathy, of doing work antithetical to her character. In the other, you have something of the calling, of great personal investment, a special relationship but also the encroach of work into every corner, minute of life and the anxiety of responsibility which far exceeds the *prima facie* scope of the work itself. It is not that the work is merely unpleasant, or long, or poorly paid, but the relations which necessarily form it that can both injure us and bring purpose. In his memoir on a life in medicine and science, *the Youngest Science*, Lewis Thomas remembers his internship at Boston City Hospital in 1933 with great fondness. At the time, no one expected to make much money in medicine and medical residents quite literally resided *in* the hospital. Their lives from the moment they woke up to the moment they found time to sleep, *if* they found it that night, was medicine. They were paid a pittance by today's standards, even factoring inflation. "It was," as Thomas remembers, "the best of times." 

Hierarchy, power, rank, class factor into the problem of moral injury as well.

"I say hello to everyone but my boss" says Mike LeFevre, a steelworker, in *Working*:

>I got broke down to a lower grade and lost twenty-five cents an hour, which is a hell of a lot...[My boss] came over after breaking me down. This guy comes over and smiles at me. I blew up. He didn't know it, but he was about two seconds and two feet away from a hospital. I said, "Stay the fuck away from me." He was just about to say something and was pointing his finger. I just reached my hand up and just grabbed his finger and I just put it back in his pocket. He walked away. I grabbed his finger because I'm married. If I'd a been a single I'd a grabbed his head. That's the difference.

Suffice it to say there is little love lost between LeFevre and his boss so to be wronged by him hardly constitutes a betrayal, and it is his marriage which purportedly keeps him from smashing the bosses head in. In a society steeped in violence, we are all aware what men with nothing to lose are capable of doing but LeFevre is merely venting his frustration and his sense of self remains intact; indeed, it is his pride and sense of duty to his family which make him indignant at being broke down. 

Medicine is different. At a teaching hospital (where most healthcare workers will train), there is a strict hierarchy differentiating administrators, attending physicians, residents, interns, nurses, managers, medical students, and techs. A high degree of trust up and down the chain of command is necessary for the delivery of care. If one cannot trust that the other has done their job, can do their job, has everyone else's and the patient's best interest in mind then the whole venture is doomed from the start. One must, to some degree, allow one's self to trust their coworkers and to have your trustworthiness, skill undermined by a superior or inferior can be disheartening, shattering. My partner told me the story of a fellow nurse who when they discovered that management was to discipline her for failing to get ice for a patient who asked for it quit their job on the spot. That the administrators even thought to threaten their credibility and position for such an unimportant complaint instead of defending them by ignoring it was a cheap and base betrayal of trust. It was a moral injury. There are countless stories like this in healthcare. So it goes.

This is all to make three simple points: first, while there are obvious material contributions which threaten the wellbeing of individual healthcare workers, we must also consider the way material conditions affect the relations of workers to eachother, to their patient, to themselves, and it is not enough to ask everyone to meditate, or even simply hire more scribes or tighten work hour restrictions in hospitals if at every instant workers are forced to compromise their commitment to the patient, to eachother for the sake of profit; second, there is nothing special or unique about our generation which makes us more prone to moral injury than ever before, rather the root causes of moral injury – preserved from the *Iliad* to the modern day – have become generalized and intensified by the totalitarian, inexorable creep of market logic into every crevice of our lives; finally, by its very nature the same relations of service and solidarity which put us at risk for moral injury have an equal capacity to fill our work with meaning and we must not do away with them, ignore them, but protect and strengthen them.

"I don't know–I just got caught up with it all, the beautiful feeling of solidarity," recalls a migrant immigrant worker in *Working* remembering the strikes which swept California in the days of Cesar Chavez's revolution. "Working in the fields is not in itself a degrading job. It's hard, but if you're given regular hours, better pay, decent housing, unemployment and medical compensation, pension plans–we have a very relaxed way of living. But the growers don't recognize us as persons. That's the worst thing, the way they treat you. Like we have no brains. Now we see they have no brains. They have only a wallet in their head. The more you squeeze it, the more they cry out."

It's one thing to call for redefinitions and another thing to ask for systemic change. The first may aid the second, but the second is impossible if the prescription is simply "freer markets". Thankfully, it's not up to ZDogg or Talbot or Dean to do this alone, or anyone for that matter. Today, resident physicians, interns, and fellows [walked off their shifts for 15 minutes](http://www.sfexaminer.com/medical-residents-interns-walk-off-job-ucsf-medical-center-failed-contract-talks/) at UCSF to fight for fairer, better, safer contracts and institutional support. When "Doctors sue the insurance companies," foretold [Brecht](https://allpoetry.com/What-Has-Happened-), "the revolution has won its first battle."
