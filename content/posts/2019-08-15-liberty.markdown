>"Give me your tired and your poor — who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge." Ken Cuccinelli, acting dir. U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services 2019. 

>"In your dread of dictators you established a state of society in which every ward boss is a dictator, every financier a dictator, every private employer a dictator, all with the livelihood of the workers at their mercy, and no public responsibility. And to symbolize this state of things, this defeat of all government, you have set up in New York Harbour a monstrous idol which you call Liberty. The only thing that remains to complete that monument is to put on its pedestal the inscription written by Dante on the gate of Hell 'All hope abandon, ye who enter here.'" George Bernard Shaw, [address](https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/shawgb-politicalmadhouse/shawgb-politicalmadhouse-00-h-dir/shawgb-politicalmadhouse-00-h.html) at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, 1933.

In 1991 Haiti's first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted from office by a military coup  d'etat. In the bloody year that followed over 37,000 Haitians fled their embattled country for the United States, were captured, and forcibly detained at Guantanamo Bay to await asylum proceedings.

[Does any of this sound familiar?](http://theconversation.com/us-turned-away-thousands-of-haitian-asylum-seekers-and-detained-hundreds-more-in-the-90s-98611)

>At its peak, the camp held more than 12,000 Haitians, cycling them as quickly as possible through the asylum review process. There, Immigration and Naturalization Services conducted asylum interviews to assess whether they were “bona fide” refugees who legitimately feared returning to Haiti. INS denied the vast majority asylum, deeming them “economic migrants” who left home solely seeking economic opportunities. The U.S. returned them to Haiti, using force to remove anyone who resisted.

>By July 1992, nearly 300 refugees remained in the camp.

>INS had determined that these 300 were “bona fide” refugees who must be granted asylum. The asylum process included health screenings. The exams revealed that most, but not all, of the 300 of the Haitians were HIV positive. A dilemma emerged for the U.S. government.

>Forcing them to return to Haiti would have violated both the 1980 Refugee Act and the 1951 Refugee Convention, whose core principle is that refugees should not be returned to dangerous conditions.

>At the same time, an HIV ban, overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 1987, barred the entry of any HIV-positive foreign person into U.S. territory. This travel ban reflected the widespread ignorance and fears of HIV during the 1980s and 1990s. A 1985 poll showed 50 percent of Americans supported quarantining anyone infected with the virus.

>Caught between refugee laws and the HIV ban, the Haitian refugees were trapped in the quarantine camp at Guantanamo alongside their family members, including children.

>Some refugees were told by various INS and military personnel that “they could be at Guantanamo for 10 to 20 years or until a cure for AIDS is found.”

>Even the sickest refugees could not enter the U.S. for treatment. Staffed with two doctors and five nurses, the camp clinic could only administer basic health care. Nevertheless, INS spokesperson Duane Austin noted on Dec. 12, 1992: “We have no policy allowing people with AIDS to come enter the United States for treatment. … They’re just going to die anyway, aren’t they?”

>The Defense Department claimed it ran Guantanamo as a “humanitarian mission,” but the refugees were subjected to deplorable conditions. They slept in rudimentary barracks with garbage bags taped over the windows. They ate inedible food, at times spoiled, even infested with maggots. The medical care was, at best, ineffective and, at worst, abusive, with medical treatment performed without informed consent.

What's my point? It's difficult to simply write it down, but I'm going to try to do so as simply as possible. 

Hiding just beneath Cuccinelli's revised inscription is the idea of *personal responsibility*. "And, you know, there's no such thing as society," to quote Thatcher, "...there are individual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look after themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbors." To her credit, Thatcher said something about neighbors, but I'd wager that the neighbors she imagined in 1987 weren't brown, black, and muslim migrants escaping the godforsaken lands she, Reagan, and their contemporaries were only then beginning to explode and exploit. 

Personal responsibility is one of the arch-narratives of conservative propaganda and consequently, as such things tend to be, a kind of shell game. The sleight of hand is as follows: if there is no collective it follows there can be no collective responsibility. So what's left? Personal responsibility and the zephyrous alignment of the interests and responsibilities of individual persons which come and go, occasionally breathed into life in contract and disappearing again with the persons themselves. But there can be no special, permanent, continuous line of responsibility attached to a collective person beyond the explicit lines of contract. There is no society. Of course, no one besides the most ideological of libertarians actually believes this. *Personal responsibility* is the rhetorical cudgel unsheathed for the post-hoc justification of what could be seen as a fault in our (putatively nonexistent) collective responsibility. When an innocent person is shot by the cops, it comes out; when there is a lack of medical care, it comes out; when a woman seeks contraception, it comes out; when a desperate family crosses the border, it comes out; and so on, and so on. If conservatism is, as Corey Robin puts it in *The Reactionary Mind*, "a meditation on — and the theoretical rendition of — the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back" then the call for personal responsibility is the revanchist's first warning; it says, "Someone, someone *irresponsible*, wants what you, *a responsible person*, has *earned*. And they want it *for free*."

Outside of the minds of the truly delusional there is no denying the existence of societies or, at the very least, of governments. The U.S. government, of course, has racked up a significant number of "personal responsibilities" which, among many other things, are intrinsically connected to the perpetual crisis at our border. 

>"We are in the most perverse social situation imaginable. From Honduras, for years, have processed the majority of people who have braved to cross Mexico's inferno to reach the borders of Eldorado. It is a nation which the United States has never let be. The Yankee dominion there is absolute, brutal, it almost seems natural. For the soldiers of the empire and servile militaries, the mercenaries and paramiliataries, Honduras has been a base of operations, brothel, no man's land. It served as a contrainsurgent platform directed towards the control of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala in their revolutionary hours, and persists as such permanently. A country without sovereignty, that when it began to develop it in the last decade, the Clinton falconness gifted to Obama a coup d'etat from the old school, clinical and merciless. Washington has decided that Honduras shall never be a country, but a comfortable accident on the map made to store backyard chess pieces."

[(Here is a link to the full essay from which that excerpt is drawn in Spanish in *La Jornada*)](https://www.jornada.com.mx/sin-fronteras/2018/10/29/el-calvario-de-la-hermandad-migrante-2290.html?fbclid=IwAR1ncJKkHSDkvZrAiVnh3CTwph9ubuXJaJ2RSYeg0q23EKG3Xs3dSHBQ1RI)

The cold hard truth is that explosions around the world have always created displacement and a great deal of those explosions have been caused (partly or wholly) by the United States in Haiti, in South and Central America, and elsewhere. The question is when will we, that is as a country, take responsibility for our own actions? 

The Trump administration's true message of liberty is not, however, Cuccinelli's, but Shaw's; "all hope abandon, ye who enter here." The administration's continuous assault on every avenue of regular immigration, the public spectacle and terrorism of ICE raids, the unjustified and illegal dismantling of asylum procedures, tightening the number of accepted refugees, dramatically slowing the legal immigration processing pipeline, punishing legal immigrants already here for using social programs, increasing and expediting deportation proceedings [all aim](https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/trumps-attacks-legal-immigration-system-explained) to create a situation so horrifying that even the most desperate people will simply stay home.

Keep people out, find ways to get rid of those who are here. The anxiety fueling this relentless wave of legally sanctioned terrorism is demographics. It's the quiet part some members and supporters of the admin, like the El Paso shooter, are willing to say loud. Indeed, the El Paso massacre is particularly relevant to this discussion. The tragedy has been so shocking and vile that it has brought the idea of white nationalism as a form of domestic terrorism into the political mainstream. The recent battle over including the citizenship question in the 2020 Census and the subsequent decision of the Trump administration to [achieve by executive order](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/14/749930756/do-trump-officials-plan-to-break-centuries-of-precedent-in-divvying-up-congress) what he could not otherwise is the most egregious example of this demographic anxiety which has been harangued by white-nationalist politics in this country for nearly one hundred years. The actions of white-nationalist terrorists and the Trump administration both embody "the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back" but the actions of a lone gunman fall more comfortably within the narrow boundaries of responsibility which we have been indoctrinated to understand — that is, of *personal* responsibility. Our political consciousness must evolve to recognize the collective violence of the concentration camps, of family separation, of arbitrary and indefinite detention, of public humiliation, of an atmosphere of constant terror predicated on race and class, the suicide of captives, the irreparable harm all of these things have done to thousands of families and children as acts of terrorism, as a line in the reckoning of our collective responsibility. 

These disparate lines of thought find their apotheosis in the Palestinian question. On the one hand, there is the violence and forced demographic-replacement of settler-colonialism; the disenfranchisement of an entire class of people; ethnonationalism; the handwringing, revision, and contestation of borders; the impossibility (and imperturbability) of migration and movement across those borders; and the decades-long Kafkaesque nightmare of the open air prison experiment that is Gaza. On the other, there is the palpable reality that the perpetual crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories is far but natural, its intensity throttled as it is by the flexibility of Israel's primary benefactor the United States in indulging the occupation's most violent transgressions. Trump's recent decision to [intervene](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-nixing-tlaib-omar-visit-netanyahu-harms-israel-to-assuage-trump-s-ego-1.7688299) in the state visit of two sitting members of Congress to Israel and the occupied territories has highlighted the strange power of the American presidency over this faraway land and the unique and poisonous relationship which can, apparently, influence one to act against its own interest and inflame its own contradictions in order to appease its most important patron. Most importantly, there is the denial. The denial that anything is going on, that there is anything like a crisis at all, that there is, in fact, only the external threat which must be extinguished with extreme prejudice. For decades and decades the Palestinian question has been politically untouchable in mainstream US politics and, although there might not be another region on the planet where the US has a comparable level of collective responsibility for its present conditions, the very fact of the occupation is regularly denied. 

Hiding the truth and horror of human suffering in plain sight, in part through the abnegation of collective responsibility, is the shell game that is being played. The deliberate [obscuration](https://prospect.org/article/ice-now-locks-everyone) of basic procedures and facts by ICE and Homeland Security, the barriers erected between the outside world and the camps, etc. are but secondary measures. The First, Big, and Important Lie is the plea for *personal responsibility*, that cynical assurance that if you do everything right then you have nothing to fear. It took 2 years for a UN envoy to get into Guantanamo and accurately report what the conditions were like for the Haitian refugees detained there, well after tens of thousands of people had already been captured, detained, fed spoiled food, kept in cramped and humiliating conditions, irreversibly traumatized. 

The migration crises which have come thus far pale in comparison to those of the future. The most widely cited estimation of new migrants to be created as a result of climate change is [200 million](https://www.iom.int/migration-and-climate-change-0) by 2050 (a figure which represents a doubling of the world's current migrant population within three decades). The good news is that this suffering is preventable. The concentration camps, Guantanamo Bay, ICE, etc. are not laws of nature or immovable objects. They are the products of our society. There is not nor has there ever been a migration crisis. The border *is* the crisis. How do we build a future which can accommodate for the hundreds of millions of people who are likely to be displaced as a byproduct of the environmental exploitation primarily perpetrated by countries like our own? I don't know. But we could start by taking some responsibility for our actions.
