Why is class such a *fraught* topic in medical training?

Honest discussion about the meaning of money, wealth, class, or the culture and attitudes surrounding those topics is rare in medicine or otherwise –– isn't that just a fact of life in the States? A curious quirk of Yanqui culture, until recently, is that in the country most fanatical about money and the pursuit of it everyone ought to be discouraged from talking about it. That said, if you browse the anonymous message boards of the medicine and premed subreddits or SDN, there's no shortage of posts or discussion about "lifestyle", income, investing, and the like.

All the same, these discussions rarely extend beyond the merely superficial aspects of how much money each medical discipline makes or the existential dread of managing the colossal sums of student debt the average junior doctor holds at graduation. In fact, it has been my personal experience that conversations which *do* delve past simple financial arithmetic quickly become delicate, heated, or even painful.

To give just one very recent example, taken from MedTwitter, an attending physician made a joke about about how medical students are always on about being "broke" but come to the hospital in a different color of Figs (a scrub brand) every day of the week. The joke's since been deleted so I'm recalling from memory, but as you can imagine it went viral and touched a nerve with many med students who felt like an attending physician –– someone we all subconsciously know is near the top 1-5% of all earners in the country by virtue of their professional standing alone –– was punching down to a fictional student who might like to have "nice" things in spite of being 200,000 dollars or more in debt. Anyways, this post is not about the tweet, the joke, the physician, or even the response to it *per se*, rather I think this particular instance is simply representative of the kinds of deep-seated anxieties that bubble over whenever class and not merely money are a part of the conversation.

Before diving in, we have to understand what the class composition of the medical profession is like to begin with. No one who is a medical student today will be surprised to learn that medical students, on average, come from the wealthiest families in the country. This is a fact that has remained unchanged for nearly half a century, if not longer, as a graph taken from a 2018 AAMC report shows below. 

![2018 AAMC report on Med Student Diversity by Parental Income](https://i.imgur.com/9SWAaDr.png)

As you can see, two-thirds of medical students come from the top quintile of earners in the U.S. and more than one in five come from households in the top 5% ($225,000 in annual income or more). As is the case for all of the professions, medicine is often a family business either figuratively or literally and it's not rare to come across a medical student with one if not two physician parents. This might provide some insight into the fact that even though the average graduating medical student owes nearly a third of a million dollars in debt, up to  30% of all medical students graduate without any debt to their name ([2020 AAMC MSGQ](https://www.aamc.org/media/46851/download)). While there are a few schools out there with debt or tuition-free financing models, or full-ride scholarships on offer, the number of students benefiting from such programs is certainly nowhere near one in three. 

So, on average, med students are rich. What else is new? Given the number and kinds of barriers leading up to admission to medical school, should anyone be surprised? No, probably not. That being said, I would argue that this fact underlies medicine's cultural unease with class and wealth. I would describe this unease specifically as the tension between the physician's proximity to illness, poverty and the dominance of petit bourgeois mores and values in the physician's professional culture. It is, in my opinion, an unease worth unraveling for our own sake, the profession's sake, and ultimately the sake of our patients. It's products are, yes, occasionally bad tweets, but also (more importantly) a social environment which is generally hostile to first-generation, low-income physicians and prevents physicians from understanding the struggles of their patients, colleagues, employees, and support staff to the detriment of the profession. The nurses making a third of your income don't want to hear you complain about your nine year-old's ever increasing private school tuition. Your classmates really don't understand what you mean when you say pediatricians are "poor". Yes, loan payments suck, and debt can be both financially and psychologically crippling but the impact of generational wealth on one's life is not trivial either.

>"The physician is the natural attorney of the poor, and social problems should largely be solved by them." ~Rudolf Virchow

>"I began to come into close contact with poverty, with hunger, with disease, with the inability to cure a child because of a lack of resources… And I began to see there was something that, at that time, seemed to me almost as important as being a famous researcher or making some substantial contribution to medical science, and this was helping those people." ~Ernesto "Che" Guevara, *Diarios de Motorcicleta*

Although there are no shortage of forces within medical training attempting to do so, unless one has been frankly lobotomized by the medical meat grinder it is self-evident that poverty and disease are inextricably linked. This fact is inescapable to anyone, not just physicians, who has spent any amount of time in a hospital or helped care for patients.

Physicians and physicians-in-training must reconcile this reality with the knowledge that the very same structures which have condemned tens of millions of people to live in poverty in this country will reward them with security, status, and lasting wealth beyond most working people's imagination. The length and intensity of training (+/- hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt) work to further draw out and muddy this struggle. There's a post by an anonymous dermatologist I've saved from many years ago that gets at a frequent result of this struggle, this 'thing':

>"...the thing that plagues people who actually want to do good. The people with good hearts, with good souls [who] want to touch the lives of patients. To really cure disease, mend the wounded, and cure the sick. Too many people enter medical school with good intentions but are then met with hours upon hours of misery, the world closing around them, their relationships lost, their souls beaten. The response? "Man, I did really well... and for what? I hate patients, I have no friends, I lost my hobbies, and now I'm in debt. Do I really want to do family medicine?"...The dermatologist is born. The reason they went into medical school is no longer the reason they want to do derm. They want a life. They want money. They did well enough to get it, so why not?" (sic, mostly) 

Now, I don't think it's fair or accurate to overlay a two-dimensional spectrum of good and evil, humanity and greed over the gamut of medical specialties with family medicine at one end and dermatology at the other. Although such is certainly the stuff of memes, reality is always more complicated. That said, there is an astonishingly linear correlation between the level of competition for "matching" into a particular specialty  (as measured by the mean Step 1 score of graduating medical students entering a specialty) and the discipline's lifetime earnings.

These are fun curiosities, but my point is rather that the conflict described above is present in the heart of *every* medical trainee, regardless of party registration or net worth.  Of course, the question for the individual of what to do about this tension is a question of self-help: How do you live with yourself? Here are a few choices:

>1. Reluctantly embrace the gospel of prosperity. ("I worked hard for this, I serve others, it's not like I'm in private equity or something. I deserve the good life and it's a shame our economic system is sustained by the exploitation of a million others.")
>2. Enthusiastically embrace the gospel of prosperity. ("Not only do I deserve to be rich, poor people deserve to be poor. Something something bootstraps, etc.")
>3. Self-care. Materially the same as 1 or 2, but with a large Instagram following.
>4. Embrace Peter Singer and give away all of the money you don't need to live. ("Give until it hurts, and then I'll be absolved, finally, having paid my tithes at the church of philanthropy. [Wait, is this the same Peter Singer that argued for infanticide of the disabled??!?](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/04/now-peter-singer-argues-that-it-might-be-okay-to-rape-disabled-people) What the fu--")
>5. Total Martyrdom. Joan of Arc, MD. ("Practicing medicine and treating sick people is bad, actually. I'm handing in my badge tomorrow to pursue an ethically unburdened career under capitalism. I believe that the presence of justice is directly correlated with my suffering and the more I suffer, the more justice there is.")

This list is a joke, btw. But ultimately I think that people are interested in feeling that they are Good and (perhaps even more importantly) being perceived as Good by others. To that end, they will spend a lot of time handwringing about whether or not they "deserve" this or that. Perhaps it's the recovering Catholic in me, but I think this particular question has a simple answer: You don't! You don't deserve it. You are in one of the single most privileged and wealthy professions in a country which also happens to be the global center of imperial domination by virtue of its past and ongoing pillaging, subjugation of the rest of the planet –– and you're probably not even a vegan. God won't forgive you, because he shouldn't. Find something slightly less intractable to worry about. 

Physicians earn incredible amounts of money not because they "deserve" it or because they work really hard or even because they take out a massive amount of loans and defer large quantities income during training. If we doled out physician pay by "merit", surely pediatric specialists wouldn't be making one third or fourth the income of your average adult specialist? If we allocated money by how hard people work then surely parents and especially mothers would have a bonus for doing the additional work of continuing the race, not to mention single parents working multiple jobs to do just that. Docs were making the big bucks even when educational debt was nearly non-existent and training was shorter, so that doesn't seem right either. No, physicians earn in direct proportion to the value they can bill to insurance companies, and in doing so generate income pulled from the collective funds of others accrued in the form of either taxes or monthly premiums. They can earn even more by owning a portion or all of their practice, or by hiring employees to help maximize or streamline their productivity and in this role are bosses. These incomes exceed what is needed to live so they are free to invest in capital or speculation, and thus increase their potential income even further. In other words, physicians live by their own work, yes, but also partially through the value created by others. In other words, Physicians are *petit bourgeois* (as opposed to the *haute bourgeoise* who do not produce anything of value themselves). This fact is reflected in the culture, mentality, and average political stance of the profession. 

>’That’s it, Pa. That’s the terrible part of it. When I was at home, and only knew what it was to be poor, I grumbled but didn’t so much mind. When I was at home expecting to be rich, I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do. But when I had been disappointed of my splendid fortune, and came to see it from day to day in other hands, and to have before my eyes what it could really do, then I became the mercenary little wretch I am.’
>‘It’s your fancy, my dear.’
>‘I can assure you it’s nothing of the sort, Pa!’ said Bella, nodding at him, with her very pretty eyebrows raised as high as they would go, and looking comically frightened. ‘It’s a fact. I am always avariciously scheming.’ -Charles Dickens, *Our Mutual Friend*

Ambiguity, ambivalence, and a strong desire for stability characterize the petty bourgeois, themselves often upwardly mobile strivers drawn from the working or professional class. The 20th century US physician is well represented here, with their skepticism of reform and sluggishness to make structural change to profession or practice but incredible enthusiasm for technology and entrepreneurship which promise to further them on their subconscious or conscious pursuit of becoming true haute bourgeois. The 21st century has both shaken and reaffirmed this paradigm, with ever-rising anxieties and endless handwringing about "mid-level encroachment" (an umbrella term for NPs and/or PAs obtaining increasingly independent practice rights in various states, practices) and  an increasing number of physicians finding more and more creative ways to not have to actually practice medicine full-time (rich, coming from me, an MD/PhD student, I know) juxtaposed with increasing physician support for universal healthcare and concern for correcting injustices within (or perpetuated by) medicine. 

To summarize: Physicians are a diverse bunch who are increasingly interested in tackling the tough social problems we face in medicine who experience varied kinds of financial stressors for much of their professional life, but are nevertheless drawn majorly from the upper classes and thus operate in a conservative professional culture that prioritizes stability and the self-interest of physicians and their guilds over radical change. The ambivalence and ambiguity of the profession's petty bourgeois mores is inherently at odds with the physician's proximity to poverty and disease. Together, this makes "class", or even simply money and wealth fraught concepts for physicians and medical trainees to contend with without the adoption of psychological defense mechanisms. 

So, why bother with all of this? If socio-economic divisions are so intractable and rooted in causes far deeper than the practice of medicine itself, why bother talking about it, distinctly, within the profession itself?

First, as I've mentioned, I think it's essential for physicians to understand the social context of their patients. It is already the case that many if not most physicians have spent the majority of their lives in a socioeconomic strata far removed from the "average" American, but it adds insult to injury that students and physicians reflexively recoil from the topic of class even amongst their friends and colleagues. I'm not stranger to seeing and hearing physicians complain about the "social work" of medicine. Indeed, tasks like wrestling with insurers, skilled care facilities, disputes between workers and bosses, or tenants and landlords are often described as the kinds of "social scut work" that turn people away from fields like hospital medicine or primary care. I don't think people should be forced to work a job they despise, but I *do* believe that more trainees and physicians would be amenable to seeing the complex or challenging social situations their patients find themselves in as opportunities for therapeutic intervention *if* they had the vocabulary and tools to do so (see [NEJM's *Social Medicine* series](https://www.nejm.org/case-studies-in-social-medicine)). In many settings, dedicated social workers on the team often fill this role, but that is an investment many institutions or practices do not make nor is it completely fair to burden the task of observing, documenting, and attending to the myriad social forces on an individual's life on one person on the team alone. Transforming social "scut" into social medicine in the minds of trainees might empower more docs to advocate for their patients, especially when navigating our labyrinthine healthcare system to ensure they don't fall through the cracks, or encourage researchers to prioritize the needs and interests of patients even as they strive to learn something new. 

Second, it is a matter of inclusion. As I've mentioned, the general culture of medicine is often hostile to first-generation or low-income trainees, even if inadvertently so. Although all physicians will likely one day hit something like a jackpot, the length and financial minefield of training, the immense weight of educational debt are all real stressors which negatively impact the livelihoods and psyches of medical trainees. The financial insecurity experienced by students and trainees in the immediate present is no less immediate by virtue of a hypothetical yet-to-be-earned wealth. Even the student destined for orthopedic spine surgery has to make rent, car, and loan payments every month for the fifteen years it will take them to get there. First-generation and low-income students are also more likely to struggle with the clash between their burgeoning white-collar professional identity and their upbringing. Even for those from privileged, middle-class upbringings, living and breathing medicine for years on end, immersed in the mores of academia can bring with it no small degree of alienation from decades of life that might as well have occurred on another planet. Everyone would benefit from more honest and grounded discussion in this regard.

To give an example, in my first year of medical school I took part in a "fishbowl" exercise on socioeconomic class as a part of an elective course where we often discussed the cross-talk between our personal and professional identities. The exercise itself is really simple: the group divides itself by some marker of identity –– in this case, self-identified high vs low-income upbringing –– and takes turns as subgroups having a discussion about what that marker means to them in the broader context of their life strictly with others in their own "in-group" while the "out-group" watches. Participants are also instructed to specifically not "respond" to the discussion they observed. It was an interesting exercise, with some themes you might be able to predict. Low-income students most often came from working-class families and were used to following strict budgets in their day-to-day life, sometimes juggling work and school off-and-on throughout their education, and often using a part of their income or student loans to help out their families in times of need. Low-income students also knew that their families had very little to nothing in savings or assets and that their career was, effectively, the family's collective retirement plan (there's also an interesting intersection here with the immigrant experience of high-income immigrants, who are often responsible for life-sustaining remittances to family "back home" –– indeed, this is my own family's experience and a responsibility I and other family members around my age take very seriously as our parents stop, or can't continue, working). The reverse of this experience, that is absence of duty or want or need, characterizes the high-income student's experience; in a word, privilege. The main benefit of this exercise, in my opinion, is to make space for a period of mutually uninterrupted listening where one can try to capture a glimpse of a perspective other than one's own. A good exercise in empathy building and non-judgmental listening for future clinicians, I think, where students might learn a little more about each other and themselves. I also reckon it's a better approximation of the "difficult conversations" we often have in medicine than an out-of-the-box role-play scenarios with zero real stakes more commonly employed in medical education. I would also hope that changing this aspect of our culture could make being a first-generation or low-income student in medicine less socially isolating.
