As a part of the Democrat's revised 3.5 T $ revision to the already passed 1.5 T $ infrastructure bill there are many provisions intended to increase investment in "human infrastructure": healthcare, jobs, education, childcare, the social safety net more broadly. Within this enormous piece of legislation are provisions like HR3 ([link to Pelosi's summary of the bill](https://www.speaker.gov/LowerDrugCosts), [link to the congress.gov full-text of the bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3/text)). As of writing, most progressives are aligned on rejecting the infrastructure bill without the revisions included in the more ambitious and expansive version supported by the House. This has caused some controversy among scientists and medical entrepreneurs out of fear that the very same provisions aimed at drastically slashing drug costs for people in the US will also cripple innovation and research in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries ("biopharma").

[Five years ago I wrote another post on this blog](https://santiago-es.netlify.app/posts/2016-07-28-drugs/) in which I outlined how similar arguments being made then about both drug revenues driving research spending and US research subsidizing global pharmaceutical innovation were either misleading or wrong. I also talk about how the European biopharma industry is able to stay competitive with the US in terms of research and innovation, and [even pull ahead by some estimates](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.w969), in spite of having precisely the kind of negotiable drug pricing scheme that detractors of HR3 and HR3-like provisions are concerned about. I also discuss one big difference between US and European biopharma, which is the absence of direct to consumer advertising in Europe (by law). Large pharmaceutical companies spend a lot of money on marketing, and most spend between [30-100% more on marketing than on R&D in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/).

I think the more disingenuous sides of this argument have already been tackled by my previous post. Included in that is the suggestion that HR3 or provisions like it is a ["price-fixing" scheme that "subverts or perverts market forces"](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1436399896387538946?s=20&fbclid=IwAR3x5VrloAXg__F3Ty0SI1sKO2Z2o1qBy0FxoYoR6IBu-N8uVZxcuxLA2y4). Like I mentioned in my original post, allowing the largest purchaser in the drug market (the federal government) to negotiate prices -- something it is currently prevented from doing by law, the only nation to my knowledge to prevent its own government from doing so -- is *by definition* creating a *free* market and allowing drug companies to be subject to market discipline by all purchasers. That said, a lot has changed in 5 years and with the, more or less, complete collapse of right-wing libertarianism, we no longer have to suffer IRL reddit shitposters insisting that free markets are good for capitalism. Free markets are probably a good thing for creating choice and variety and innovation, but certainly not for profits or capitalists who unequivocally prefer unregulated monopolies, of which biopharma has a few (*cough* [Illumina](https://frontlinegenomics.com/how-did-illumina-monopolize-the-sequencing-market/) *cough*). Indeed, this is actually a literal argument already made by industry insiders against HR3 [several years ago](https://www.statnews.com/2019/12/09/hr3-wrong-path-lower-drug-costs/) implying that increasing risk and decreasing ROI for biopharma would drive investor money to the fattest, most unregulated pool of monopolies in our economy, the tech sector:

>"A recent email I received from a cell therapy company CEO provides important context. This CEO wrote that the company will need heavy investment to bring its cell therapy to market. But the price caps being envisioned in H.R. 3 would dramatically limit the return on that investment. As a result, investors would likely look to a less regulated environment, such as tech, and a promising therapy would never get a chance to help patients."

All that being said, there are I think very genuine and relevant elements to the arguments against provisions to radically decrease drug pricing. Although my blog might make some thing otherwise, I am not categorically against biopharma companies making money. Under capitalism, the profit motive is the mission that drives resources to realize material gains and better, more, safer, or more powerful therapies and interventions are *real* material gains that I very much support. It is also true, as the article I linked above points out, that most new therapies come from startups and small companies which are often "spun-out" of academia or industry giants and are later acquired if their products are shown to be safe and effective. It is precisely these smaller companies that likely feel the most threatened by the prospect of decreased private investment in biopharma and also these very same companies that are most likely to actually pour the lion-share of their investor dollars into R&D instead of marketing. So is lowering drug prices a Pyrrhic victory, as some would suggest?

The short answer is that I'm not sure. Ever since late 2019 I've effectively dropped out of the business of predicting the future. What I am is *highly skeptical* of the argument that investor money would dry up or that the job market for biosciences would collapse. Further, I am extremely, keenly aware of the desperate need to lower drug costs to citizens in the United States as the status quo of what people have to go through to fund life-sustaining treatment is at its very best barbaric and morally bankrupt. 

The [CBO's report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55936) reads:

>[CBO] estimates that under the bill, approximately 8 fewer drugs would be introduced to the U.S. market over the 2020-2029 period, and about 30 fewer drugs over the subsequent decade. (Under current law, the Food and Drug Administration approves, on average, about 30 new drugs annually, suggesting that about 300 drugs might be approved over the next 10 years.) The estimates are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes, in CBOâ€™s assessment, and are uncertain.

This projection comes as a result of a projected 19% contraction in global revenue of new drugs, which of course would be somewhat offset by the likely increased production and sale of existing drugs as lower prices increase access to existing treatments. To me, this seems a modest price to pay for lowering healthcare costs and increasing access to medications. 

There is also the question of what drives innovation in the biopharma industry: the rate of profit or the production of new knowledge? My observation is that these two elements are both in cooperation and opposition with one another. They cooperate because the higher the rate of profit, the lower risk of investment, and the higher the availability of capital to bring innovations to market; and they oppose one another in the sense that the speculative promise of inflated returns on capital investment make it more likely that capital will simply be wasted if the main engine of scientific progress -- the generation of new knowledge and creation of new tools through basic science -- is not healthily maintained. The discoveries which drive innovation forward, while increasingly made in industry, are largely made in the public sector. Like I mentioned in my original blog post on drugs, the socialization of the highest risk element of biotech and pharmaceutical development (basic knowledge production) occurs by the dirt-cheap if not outright free application of knowledge created with public dollars -- all in the service of ultimately private profits. From my vantage point, allowing the government to negotiate the prices of products which depend strongly on work originally funded by the public is a way for the public to recapture their original investment in basic science not just by enjoying new treatments and therapies, but also by enjoying increased and less burdensome access to the very same.

The price of drugs will certainly not stop basic scientists from working. Some of those discoveries will spark ideas for novel treatments, and if those treatments provide real promise and are genuinely innovative, the money will come. That's basically my belief. Elevated risk and lower revenues may scare away some establishment types who are simply looking for the highest ROI regardless of the product, but if my time in Silicon Valley has taught me anything is that smart money isn't going to let a tractable and promising idea languish in obscurity. Andreessen Horowitz isn't going to close its bio fund just a few short years after declaring the twenty-first century ["the Century of Biology"](https://a16z.com/2017/06/21/jorge-conde-bio-fund/) just because biopharma now has to play by same rules in the US as it does elsewhere. I mean, we live in a world where [George Church was able to raise 15 million dollars for an effort to un-extinct the woolly mammoth](https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/13/woolly-mammoths-george-church-colossal-launches/#:~:text=Church%20and%20his%20colleagues%20announced,to%20be%20more%20like%20mammoths.), surely the next new promising technology to treat presently untreatable diseases can do the same. We will have to wait and see.
