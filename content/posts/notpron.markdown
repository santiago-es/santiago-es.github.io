I don't remember how I found notpron, but I must've been twelve or thirteen when I did. At the time, I would sit up late at night on the Pendragon message boards, reading fan-fiction (I wrote some as well but mercifully the forums are now [defunct](https://djmachalebooks.com/forums-to-close/)) and it stands to reason someone linked me to the game from there. What is notpron? The name notpron is a joke about the site *not* being pr0n (porn in script-kiddie speak circa 2005). That is true. It describes itself as "the hardest riddle available on the internet". That is also true; I'd wager it's one of the hardest games ever made, *period*. In fact, of the 19,128,403 players who have attempted notpron since 2004 only 64 have ever finished the game (without cheating). The early internet was a bizarre place and I'd like to mark one curious relic from its history.

The game was created by ~some sadistic fuck~ a German game developer named David Münnich. It has 140 levels. Each level is a puzzle contained in a single screen and you advance to the next level by deciphering the puzzle and entering the answer in the appropriate text box, be it a popup or by changing the URL directly. Sometimes, special Google bar which excludes links to the spoiler-ridden notpron forums serves as an aid. The game is at once deceptively simple and incredibly complex. On the one hand, all of the clues you need are right in front of you on a single page...but the key clues might be hidden in the image, in the background music, in the URL, in hidden text, in the source code of the webpage itself. Playing notpron was for me, as it undoubtedly was for many others, a crash course on the technology of the web. Notpron is to web games what manual transmissions are to driving cars. Sure, you've driven your entire life but hop in a stick shift and suddenly you're thinking about RPMs, about literally clutching the engine in to disconnect it from the gear box, about the size and weight of different gears, about when you need more power to climb a hill and how to use the least you possibly can to save fuel. Notpron made the web transparent, tactile because it forced you to look under the hood and think about how information can be communicated through the internet, to literally take the bits of code and pixel in front of you and mold it in your hand. It is not that it made the web comprehensible in spite of being a baffling puzzle game; rather, it made the web comprehensible precisely *because* it is a baffling puzzle game.

A brief detour into brutalism. 

There's a somewhat curious school of web design (most closely associated with high fashion, modern and performance art, and avant garde internet lit/art) which has attempted to transport the *ethos* of brutalist architecture to the world wide web. In the words of [one such curator](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) of so-called "brutalist websites":

>In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today's web design.

Brutalist websites are lightweight, wicked-fast, barebones, efficient web-to-brain content delivery vehicles. I love the concept; stumbling onto a "brutalist" page ([e.g. click me (**SEIZURE WARNING**)](https://ravecon0.org/)is like falling into some once and future vision of an anarchic cyberpunk society. My sensitivity towards this aesthetic is captured in very this blog which is generated purely through static pages of Markdown and simple HTML5/CSS on top of Hugo. In purely aesthetic terms, notpron reflects the brutalist *ethos* not out of nostalgia or philosophy but as a product of a time where so-called "brutalist" web design was the *only* web design.

I think games like notpron have a lot to teach us about good game design, puzzles, how we interact with content online, about the way the internet was and the way it *could be* — in particular, as a tool that can be engaged with directly, by anyone to solve challenging problems. The notpron boards are filled with over 15 years of players discussing each and every level, sharing what they tried, what worked and didn't, and helping newer players get on the right track. As a basic scientist and sci-fi nerd, I imagine a (better) world where the majority of humanity is finally free from the tyranny of spending their whole existence working to live and curious and capable minds in not just the developed world but the whole world are free to explore the problems that interest them, together, from every corner of the world. Entirely holographic laboratories stored in the web, maintained by artificial intelligence to simulate, with tremendous and mysterious accuracy, the conditions of, say, a metabolic pathway in a cell. Interested humans self-organized into freely shifting, transient teams of open-source investigators asking themselves what the next interesting experiment might be and generating preliminary data and hypotheses for their organic counterparts to test rigorously (at much greater expense) at the various institutes around the world dedicated to that sort of thing. It's science-fiction, I know, but not impossible. If that, or something like that, ever becomes a reality I think we'll look back at our homogenous and tightly controlled social networks driven mostly to generate ad-revenue as primitive, regressive, and look at web-places like notpron with their stimulating, inclusive, raw content and transient but spontaneous and passionate community of aficionados as precursors to that brighter future.

Oh, and [you can still play it](http://notpron.org/notpron/) — that is, if you're up for it.
