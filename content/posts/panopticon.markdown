# Mt. Rushmore, Harpers, Amy Cooper, and Bloodlust on Twitter

On the topic of censorship and justice, I am not so concerned with the [facile and shallow noises](https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/) of the darlings of elite cultural institutions.

That said, when Trump, J.K. Rowling, Gamergate trolls, and Noam Chomsky suddenly find themselves even in the same Zip code of the same side of an argument that signals to me that there is something in this political moment worth drawing attention to. 

> In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance.  If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished.  It’s not going to happen to us.

These are the words Trump spoke at Mt. Rushmore on the [4th of July](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-south-dakotas-2020-mount-rushmore-fireworks-celebration-keystone-south-dakota/) but cut the bit about far-left fascism and it could just as easily have been pulled from the Harper's letter. 

> The free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted. While we have come to expect this on the radical right, censoriousness is also spreading more widely in our culture: an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty. We uphold the value of robust and even caustic counter-speech from all quarters. But it is now all too common to hear calls for swift and severe retribution in response to perceived transgressions of speech and thought. More troubling still, institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.

Cut the respective digs at the other side of the political spectrum and you'll find some of that thing talking heads on TV have claimed disappeared from this earth: common political ground. If you think I'm going to walk into the cliché of proclaiming Both Sides Are The Same in a fit of horseshoe shaped armchair solipsism, I'm not. But I do recognize a common element: the experience of having power and the feeling of it slipping away.

Trump might be a "Conservative" in the U.S. political sense of the word, but most of the institutions, brands, and cultural icons represented in that letter are themselves made inherently conservative through their symbiotic relationship with the status quo. "The conservative, to be sure, writes for a special kind of victim," writes Corey Robin in *the Reactionary Mind*, "one who has lost something of value, as opposed to the wretched of the earth...his constituency is the contingently dispossessed." The immediate question is what price, exactly, cancel culture inflicts on the cancelled. Its answer? It varies: A job, a reputation, a platform, an event, a book deal, maybe nothing at all. And then there's Amy Cooper.

After succumbing to a plausible persecution complex and weaponizing her racism and the racism of the police against a Black man in Central Park who merely told her to follow the rules of the park, Amy Cooper lost her job and her reputation has been roundly obliterated on a national scale. Now, she has had legal charges placed against her by the state. This has created some controversy on social media. As for me, I'm broadly in agreement with [Marc Lamont Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDKxl0hAw88). To summarize Hill, "...we can't think of punishment and revenge as our first response to problems and crises. We have to ask ourselves, What does Justice demand?" 

But I digress. My point is that Amy Cooper is an Extremely Cancelled Person. And while she is a wealthy and privileged person who will probably still be better off than most people in this country by this time next year, she is also not the President of the United States, a professor at Stanford University, or even J.K. Rowling. In other words, in terms of social, political, cultural, and in many cases even material capital she has nothing on the aforementioned parties. But something tells me it's not the Amy Coopers of the world that Trump or the Harper's cosignatories are concerned about. 

Trump's speech and the letter are both engaging in dishonesty but different kinds of dishonesty. Trump, for one, doesn't give two shits about tolerance or liberty or whatever. He's just beating the same drum right-wing culture warriors have been for years from his bully pulpit to a base that genuinely believes capital-C Conservative voices are being forcibly silenced on college campuses, in the press, in schools, on social media, and in public life more generally. My suspicion about most of the Harper's cosignatories is that they are just mad about people calling them out on their bullshit on Twitter. Chomsky and Rushdie are lifelong free-speech absolutists, and with good reason, frankly, given their individual life experiences, although I disagree with that position (here is the counterexample to the letter; it is, in fact, still possible to think people are wrong without brandishing pitch-forks). And while I strongly object to merely declaring guilt-by-association instead of really aiming for the content of the letter as a point of criticism, the presence of [Bari Weiss](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/04/why-we-all-hate-bari-weiss-so-much) on that list should, as many have pointed out, raise alarm bells about whether there was even an attempt at making the letter's argument in good faith. 

I'm not the biggest fan of invoking Whataboutism but in this case I think it is highly appropriate: What about the [Oglala Lakota](https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/treaty-defenders-block-road-leading-to-mount-rushmore-ctPNfZ1W0UiABOWreb-srA)? Unlike the folks with endowed chairs at prestigious universities or cushy C-suite jobs, they have actually lost something: land. On some of that land stands Mt. Rushmore, a monument, in their (and my) reading, to the genocide of indigenous people which they, as a sovereign nation, have never agreed to surrender. Their autonomy and sovereignty has been under violent and continuous assault for hundreds of years. Has anyone asked them what they think about the free speech and tolerance of dissenting views we are desperately trying to protect?
