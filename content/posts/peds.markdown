title: Prasad is Quixote; the AAP, a windmill

The year is 2022, USA, a lone adult oncologist leads a personal crusade against the American Academy of Pediatrics for reasons. What are these reasons? Are they stupid? Dear reader, they are far more stupid than you can possibly imagine –– but not stupid enough, apparently, to prevent him from calling for the dissolution of the nearly century old guild. ["The AAP is a failed organization," the oncologist writes, on account of being "captured by increasingly vocal advocates on the political left" and has "sacrificed millions in order to score a pyrrhic victory against Trump."](https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/the-aap-american-academy-of-pediatrics) Strong words. So, how did pediatricians, and the AAP as their surrogate, abandon our nation's children? To be exceedingly brief, Vinay Prasad says its because of hubris: specifically, the hubris of forsaking science and supporting continued childhood masking in schools and remote schooling during an earlier phase of the pandemic. Let's take a closer look at his latest salvo in which he adovcates for the abolition of the AAP and the establishment of a "non-partisan" federal agency "like the CBO" which studies the impact of policies on children and is exclusively dedicated to their welfare.

## Peanuts

Prasad begins by relitigating a recommendation the AAP outlined in *Pediatrics* in the year 2000 (and later overturned in 2008) for breastfeeding mothers of children at high-risk for developing food allergies (high-risk for atopy at the time defined as a family history of food allergy in both parents or one parent and one sibling) to "consider eliminating eggs, cow's milk, fish, and perhaps other foods" and delaying "peanuts, nuts and fish" until "at least 3 years of age" (*Pediatrics* 106; 2 August 2000). Prasad's post mortem of the AAP's mistake came down to accusing them of lacking humility and privileging their own interventionist bias or hubris before there was any evidence to justify their recommendations. Here's Prasad in his own words:

>In short, the AAP got it wrong.

>Did they AAP need to issue their 2000 guidance at all? Some contend that the AAP had to say something. But this is false. They could have simply admitted: we don’t have data. They might have suggested a randomized studies with at least 3 randomizations (factorial design). Randomize woman to their advice (don’t eat peanuts or not) during pregnancy, during breastfeeding, and for introducing solid foods.

>Had the AAP admitted uncertainty and suggested a trial in 2000, two things might have happened. Fewer peanut allergies over the next decade (as there would be less off-protocol use), and the trial might have launched and resulted sooner.

It's hard to take issue with that analysis if the underlying facts –– the AAP "didn't have data", never suggested any trials, or never admitted uncertainty –– were true...but they are not.

In the very same article where Prasad pulls the AAP's recommendations for mothers of infants at high-risk for developing a food allergy, the AAP writes: 

>Recent studies, one a randomized and prospectively controlled study of preterm infants followed up for 18 months and a second prospective nonrandomized and uncontrolled study of full-term infants followed up for 17 years, have demonstrated that breastfeeding exclusively for at least 6 months reduces the risk of later respiratory allergic symptoms and eczema. Although many of the studies that have examined the ability of breastfeeding to delay or prevent allergic disease have significant methodologic shortcomings, the total of these studies suggests that breastfeeding exclusively has a protective effect, at least in high-risk infants and particularly if it is combined with maternal avoidance of cow’s milk, egg, fish, peanuts and tree nuts during lactation.

>More definitive prospective studies of the use of alternative formulas for allergy prophylaxis in highrisk infants are needed. However, the prospective studies available that utilized blinded food challenges to confirm allergic symptoms suggest that asymptomatic formula-fed infants at high risk for allergy given alternatives to cow’s milk formulas may have a lower future risk of allergic disease or delayed onset of allergic symptoms. In one recently reported study, infants at high risk for allergy fed an extensively hydrolyzed formula or breastfed infants whose mothers avoided cow’s milk, egg, and peanuts and did not introduce these foods into their infants’ diets had a reduced prevalence of all allergic disorders at 1 year compared with the control group fed a standard cow’s milk formula. However, at 7 years of age there were no differences in allergic respiratory symptoms between the 2 groups.

The studies they cite in this paragraph are [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7564787/), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1662577/), and [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3339499/); a prospective study, a randomized prospective study, and a literature review discussing the shortcomings of evidence on the question of breastfeeding vs formula feeding for the prevention of allergy development. The primary source of evidence for food avoidance in mothers of high-risk infants appears to stem from [this prospective randomized trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7797786/). 

A NEJM editorial on the 2015 RCT which definitely showed maternal food restriction actually *increased* the risk of developing food-borne allergies in high-risk infants also provides some relevant history (Gruchalla and Sampson, NEJM 2015):

>In 2000, largely in response to outcomes reported in infant feeding trials conducted in Europe and the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that parents refrain from feeding peanuts to infants at risk for the development of atopic disease until the children reached 3 years of age. However, since the number of cases of peanut allergy continued to rise, many investigators and clinicians began questioning this advice. In 2008, after reviewing the published literature, the AAP retracted its recommendation, stating that there was insufficient evidence to call for early food avoidance.

My own post mortem is this: in hindsight, it was clearly a mistake to make a recommendation for a significant intervention (total avoidance of certain foods for years) with little evidence of protection or a considerable mechanistic understanding for the development of food allergy in infants. For those of us who are clinicians or clinicians-in-training we should always remember the existence of a guideline is not license to abandon critical thinking or reviewing the evidence yourself. However, the AAP made the recommendation with just as little evidence or intuition of the harm their recommendation would cause, if any, and reversed it when it was clear there was no substantial evidence of its benefit in better studies designed to that end. The AAP also acknowledged the shortcomings of the evidence in its first recommendations document and calls for more randomized, placebo-controlled trials to understand the benefit, if any, of hypoallergenic formulas. Therefore, to suggest that the AAP simply pulled recommendations out of the blue because "they had to say something" about the development of food borne allergies and failed to express uncertainty or suggest trials is misleading at best. Recommendation making bodies should learn from this error, and likely have as standards for evidence-based practice have greatly changed or improved over the past twenty years. All in all, this is a precautionary tale about the ordinary process of medical recommendations: some observations or evidence exists, recommendations are made, new evidence arises, and recommendations are changed. So, why bring this up, at all, in prelude to discussing childhood masking and vaccination policies during the current pandemic? 

## The AAP "sacrifices" children

Prasad is rhetorically setting up the AAP as an untrustworthy organization: to use this single example as an anchor point for the reader to view the AAP as an influential organization with little regard for science or evidence, but motivated to wield its influence anyway for other reasons. Indeed, Prasad's (extraordinarily bad faith) reading of the AAP's policy statements claims that the "AAP sacrifices kids to prevent Trump from a political win." Here's VP again:

>Between June and July 2020, according to National Public Radio reporting, the AAP “Walk[ed] Back Support For In-Person School.”

>The facts are simple. The AAP initially put forth the right decision, “recommending that education leaders and policymakers "should start with a goal of having students physically present in school" by fall of 2020.

>Then Trump famously voiced his full-throated support for reopening schools 100% by the fall, and cited the AAP report as evidence he was correct. (For the record: Trump was correct about this one issue).

>The AAP immediately began walking back support for children. The AAP president said, “local coronavirus infection rates and hot spots have to be taken into consideration to safely reopen schools.” But, this was inaccurate. European experience showed that reopening was possible irrespective of local infection rates; Kids could benefit from school, even in places with high spread, and schools could safely reopen even there.

>In an NPR interview the AAP president, specifically criticized Florida, whose governor was Republican that its plan to aggressively reopen schools was against their recommendation.

>Ultimately, the AAP issued a second statement that further eroded support for schools. This statement was cosigned by, “the two national teacher unions and AASA, the School Superintendents Association.” The statement said, “Public health agencies must make recommendations based on evidence, not politics.”

Simple, right? The AAP made the right call, Trump used their statement in support of his effort to re-open schools in the fall of 2020 (thus, by Prasad's reckoning, "poisoning" the position), and the AAP quickly pivoted to save face amongst what I suppose VP's audience is to presume are the sycophantically partisan, uh, supporters? patrons? of the AAP. If the AAP is politically pandering here, it's not entirely clear to me *to whom* it is supposed to be pandering to or to what end. Pediatricians? "Leftist" pediatricians? In any case, is this a fair recounting of the events of summer 2020? No, it isn't.

The [AAP did call for a return to "safe, in-person learning" in June of 2020](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/10/889848834/nations-pediatricians-walk-back-support-for-in-person-school) and after receiving criticism for not including language or recommendations taking account the concerns of teachers and other school staff, changed them to include more information on improving school ventilation, masking children and staff, and taking into account local community transmission or "hot spots" in addition to asking federal and local governments to provide the resources to implement those and other pandemic safety measures in their schools –– and reiterated their support for returning to in-person learning as quickly as possible. When "Trump voiced his full-throated support" the AAP's top representative at the time, [Dr. Sally Gozar, was right there with him](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/08/888853601/school-reopenings-should-keep-public-health-in-mind-pediatric-group-says). While Prasad makes it seem like the AAP issued recommendations and when the AAP found Trump seized on them quickly scrambled to about face, the AAP was perfectly comfortable supporting then president Trump's call for school re-opening. [That said, Gozar clarified in an NPR interview some of her reservations on how the recommendations might be implemented in different states, here Florida](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/08/888853601/school-reopenings-should-keep-public-health-in-mind-pediatric-group-says):

>**NPR**: [In Florida] the virus is spiking: The number of new cases daily has been alarming, as is the case in some other states. Schools are being ordered to open in-person five days a week as early as next month in Florida, so just talk me through what the argument is for a decision like that right now?
>**Gozar**: So our guidelines reflect what we know right now about COVID-19 and its effects on children, as well as our own expertise and understanding of the benefits of in-person education for children's mental, emotional and physical health. And we reevaluate these guidelines regularly, since the pandemic changes so rapidly. But our latest guidelines articulate that our main goal is for students to be physically present at school this fall. But we also recognize that COVID-19 remains a very real, active threat to community health. And we really believe that decisions on when and how to reopen need to consider a variety of factors, but a big one is the level of virus in the community.
>**NPR**: Well, let me just ask about that — the level of virus in the state of Florida — we saw 7,000 new cases in a single day this week. I mean, would you encourage schools to open today if that decision had to be made based on the numbers you're seeing?
>**Gozar**: The way the numbers are looking in Florida right now are concerning. The level of the virus is really high. And so a statewide mandate to reopen [schools] without consideration of community spread really goes against our recommendations.

When Prasad mentions Florida, he makes it seem as if Gozar is singling out a Republican-led state for admonition but Gozar *is asked specifically about Florida in the interview*. If you read the rest of the interview, you will see she is speaking in general terms and references Florida as a specific case, making no mention of DeSantis, Republicans, or even Trump whatsoever.

Does a supposed policy "expert" like Prasad literally believes that school re-opening is a completely one-sided problem which should never take any account the concerns of other stakeholders like the community, teachers, or staff that are able to provide children with the educational environment they need? Does the fact that we are discussing the first summer of the pandemic, and the first, far less infectious variant of COVID-19 change how we interpret this period? How about the fact that at this period in time we have very little knowledge of when and how vaccines will be made available to the public, or how effective they will really be? Yes, but there's no time to even get into that because the avalanche of deceit keeps on coming. 

## Vinay Prasad Does Not Know How to Read

Masking in schools is admittedly a very complex topic. Schools are not created equal, nor are communities or the conditions children find at school, home, or elsewhere. In some communities, a mandate may be adhered to and in ohters less so, while some communities may have much higher levels of transmission or risk of transmission at home and in the community than others. It is therefore challenging to thoroughly understand the impact of source control interventions in school settings –– but that doesn't mean we can't draw useful conclusions from the evidence we can gather. Prasad is strongly against masking children in schools. To summarize his position: he doesn't think the kinds of masks kids are likely to wear are very effective, that they are even wearing them, and that certain school-specific factors like nap time or lunch time can counteract the alleged efficacy of masks as COVID-19 source control. This is not my area of research or scientific expertise, so I'm not going to discuss childhood masking at length –– but I do know how to appraise information in good faith, and Prasad is most certainly not doing that in this case, yet again.

He cites a couple of studies in his blog post, supposedly "the best studies on the topic" in his own words. 

The first is a Finnish study that is a giant nothingburger. Cleverly, his blog link to the study instead redirects you to his youtube video on the topic (hell yea baby let's get that bread) but I'll link to the never peer-reviewed preprint [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.04.22272833v1.full.pdf) since the entire article consists of about three paragraphs you could read in about 10 minutes. The data and code for this paper not available in spite of it consisting of 2 R figures and data obtained from a national registry. The "natural experiment" Prasad lauds in this paper consists of looking at the average community incidence of COVID-19 vs the "average percent change" in COVID-19 incidence in 10-12 year olds in two cities, Helsinki (where school mask recommendations were implemented for children 12+) and Turku (where school mask recommendations were implemented for children 10+) over a two-week period in January of 2021. The paper finds no difference in "average percent change" of covid-19 incidence over the two week period in these two cities. Concluding anything from this absolute water cracker of a paper is a nonstarter. 

The second is a study from Spanish schools, now published in [*Archives of Diseases in Childhood*](https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2022/08/23/archdischild-2022-324172) which looked at the effect of mandatory masking in schools on COVID-19 transmission between either 5 year olds or younger (who were not required to mask by the rule) and those 6 years and up (who were) and found no association between school mask mandates and decreased COVID-19 transmission. 

Prasad once again accuses the AAP of ignoring the evidence on school masking and "never running a cluster RCT". 

>The burden in medicine and public health is to show evidence of benefit, and yet the AAP has never done that. The organization has never run a single cluster RCT to demonstrate masking kids works in any setting. This is despite the fact that it has continued to recommend masking for 2+ years. The AAPs statement ran counter to European government advice. 

Ah, but if you actually read the AAP's statements you can just look for yourself to see what evidence they relied on to craft the policy document. For example, data from arizona showing [schools without mask mandates were 3.5 times more likely to have COVID-19 outbreaks than those who didn't](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7039e1.htm), and also [other data from 520 US counties which showed those which implemented school mask mandates had fewer pediatric cases of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7039e3.htm). Now, this data isn't perfect either and confounders abound. I'm sure Vinay has touched on them at some point or another, I presume, in one of his many online screeds or videos or podcasts or substack blog posts across his two substacks on the topic. But, again, my point is not to conduct a thorough appraisal of the evidence for and against masking in schools, rather to simply ask the question: is it fair to believe that Vinay Prasad is appraising the evidence for his audience in good faith? I think the only conclusions one can draw are either "No" or "Vinay Prasad does not know how to read". 

To belabor the point, are these "the best studies on the topic" of the impact of temporary school closures or masking on COVID-19 transmission? They are certainly not the only ones. Since Prasad loves to turn to the enlightened Continent for wisdom on masking in schools lets look at more evidence from Europe. [In one Swedish study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2020834118), schools which remained open in the Spring of 2020 led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases among teachers, their partners, and parents of children at the school of becoming infected with COVID-19 (of 100%, 29%, and 17% increased risk, respectively). In spite of the feverishly overhyped preprints Prasad and co love to gush about on Twitter, many European countries have kept their mask mandates or reimplemented them after a period of hiatus including [France, Greece, Italy, Belgium, and Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/masks-for-school-students-mandatory-in-several-eu-countries). The Nordic countries are the exceptions, not the norm, in this case. Furthermore, on our own continent new studies have shwon that school mask mandates likely do have a protective effect in [preventing COVID-19 cases and children from missing school in spite of the schools which sustained masking in the study being older, more impoverished, and in lower income and higher risk communities](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278385v1).

## About Faces

The rest of Prasad's blog post is focused on whether or not masking in schools will lead to the developmental damage of children given that:

>"...no historical studies could document the impact on long term communication among kids deprived of seeing faces because no society on earth has ever embarked on such a deranged experiment. No society has deprived children of seeing faces on this scale and for this time for so long, so naturally robust evidence of harm cannot exist." 

This is the latest argument to sweep the right flank of MedTwitter by storm: masking leads to developmental and especially language delay in children. A statement so absurd and so bereft of rigor it is absurd to even take it seriously as an argument. So much for humility in the absence of strong evidence, I guess. All I'm going to say on the subject are two things: First, people study this, let's familiarize ourselves with that body of work before we take the word of grifter MDs on the internet as gospel. Second, we are not "depriving children of seeing faces". Children are and will continue to see faces: at home, at recess, at lunch, outside in general, on television, on the computer, on the phone, on social media, in physical images, in digital images, in video games...among myriad other places. Could keeping a child from ever seeing a human face lead to developmental delay? I'm certain that it can...that is also not the appropriate question to be asking in this instance and, oh my god I can't believe I'm actually typing this, *a full professor of medicine and epidemiology at UCSF should know that*.
