First, a recap.

The past few months of widespread death and suffering as a result of the lethal combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and our nation's collective incompetence responding to it have seen even the stuffiest of grand old scientific institutions –– Nature, Science, *the* NEJM –– shed their apolitical veneers and issue grand statements urging Americans to vote this administration out for all our sakes. 

In the past few weeks, two dueling petitions have been released: first, the "great barrington declaration" (gbd); second, and in response to the first, the "john snow memo" (jsm). They are both not quite so much detailed strategies as political manifestos taking a stance on what kind of collective action public health a crisis such as this demands. The GBD takes the stance of advocating for "protection of the most vulnerable" while the rest of the population returns to "normal" in an effort to speed towards herd immunity in a portion of the population; JSM takes the position that a robust and continual mobilization of public resources could allow us to return to degrees of normalcy, as other countries have done, depending on the state of viral spread which will be controlled with measures of physical distancing, rapid and mass testing, and contact tracing to control outbreaks until a vaccine arrives.

This post, as many on my blog, has been inspired by someone else be wrong on the internet. The culprit this time is Vinay Prasad, a UCSF oncologist, who has penned [this op-ed](https://www.medpagetoday.com/blogs/vinay-prasad/89177) entitled "Great Barrington vs. John Snow is a false choice." You should read it before you read on as I believe this op-ed really encapsulates a certain belief about politics, rarely articulated as such, that is incredibly common among liberal academics, perhaps even more so amongst physicians in particular. Namely, that the point of politics is policy and the best, most achievable policy is created through reasoned debate "across the isle" so to speak. Or, in Dr. Prasad's own words: 

>"The goal of policy in each and every place on earth is to minimize the total harm to the people who live there...The declaration and memorandum are both online and taking signatures, but is this how complex policy should be decided?...Worse, the dueling petitions further divide us, when we should be talking together and working together. It does not escape me that many forces seek to tie these petitions to the Republican and Democratic parties -- a dangerous but growing movement to equate pandemic policy with politics. Signing these petitions may already be a form of identity or virtue signaling, letting others in our political circles know that we are on the virtuous team. Moreover, having signed them, we may be less likely to be willing to change our mind..."

I've been reading Dr. Prasad's book, *Malignant*, about how "bad research and bad policy hurt cancer patients" and it's really quite good and informative. So, when it comes to drug policy, clinical research, and research ethics I do genuinely consider Dr. Prasad an expert. That said, his hardline utilitarian perspective on what policy is and how it functions in practice is idealistic at best, although I don't disagree in principle that it's a nice idea. I have been for a long time skeptical of any and all utilitarian arithmetic about value and harm that is unwilling or unable to articulate the set of foundational values from which its judgement of harm and benefit stem.

First, it is fallacious to suggest that whichever petition garners the most signatures will set national policy, or even influence it. It is equally fallacious to believe that reasoned, bipartisan debate has anything to do with how policy is generated. In my brief experience on Capitol Hill, discussions about policy are primarily about horse trading, strategy, and positioning, and substantial changes in the negotiation depend on the movement of levers of power (either from above or below, more frequently from above) more so than they do on "reasoned bipartisan debate." In fact, [we can see this empirically](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf). In our system of government, the strongest predictor of policy adoption is if wealthy and powerful groups are –– through selfish interest, coercion, or political pressure –– supporting it. Policy is, ultimately, about power.

But this is getting a bit off track as I do not believe neither the gbd or jsm are about policy. Both are propaganda, each serving its own distinct purpose, and not morally comparable in their intended effect. 

The impact of the gbd, regardless of the authors' intent, is to provide the administration with a way to say, "Look! We're following the science! These scientists are saying what we've been saying all along." The specifics of the text or how its "strategy" is meant to be implemented are utterly unimportant. It is a political prop. A cudgel blessed by a facsimile of scientific "dissent" with which to beat the public –– well, some of them anyway –– quite literally to death.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most morally repulsive thing about the Barrington declaration is that it hinges on preferential protection for the vulnerable knowing that our history is of systematic and unrelenting violence, indifference towards the sick &amp; marginalized — it is a death sentence for the poor</p>&mdash; santiago sanchez (@santiagokique) <a href="https://twitter.com/santiagokique/status/1316771622918008833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To be perfectly clear, the administration was going to do whatever the fuck it pleased regardless of what scientists did or did not say. For the past eight months, this administration has taken every single opportunity to undermine dissenting or critical voices in the scientific and medical community and, with few exceptions, surrounded itself with sycophants and hacks willing to tow the party line which has led to more than 210,000 deaths and a collapsing economy. Many of the gbd authors are themselves these very same sycophants who have appeared on conservative talk shows parroting lies and misinformation for months in cynical service of their own agendas.

Conversely, the jsm is a reaction to the gbd; a counterbalance meant to correct the record on where the weight of expert consensus stands. Furthermore, it is not as if debate has been completely eschewed. For the entire duration of the pandemic, many of the signatories of the jsm have appeared in the news, in scientific journals, on social media arguing against the same people who wrote the gbd. Neither document introduces new points. Prasad takes this to mean neither side is willing to engage in meaningful discussion and therefore these petitions are emblematic of a kind of political intransigence preventing the U.S. from implementing balanced, evidence-based policy. I think it is far more accurate to say that the powers that be have long decided what their approach, or lack thereof, to the pandemic would be and bestowed their favor on those who would support them who have then gone on to ignore or fail to respond to broad and systematic criticism of their ideas. We are not going to debate ourselves towards better pandemic policy because the people with the majority of the power to set pandemic policy have not been willing to engage with criticism from the start. 

It must also be said that to "meet in the middle" in this specific discussion is to admit that we're not just willing to let some people die, but especially those people who are the most vulnerable in our society. People are dying, both ways, lockdown or free-for-all! Consider all benefits and harms says Prasad, the utilitarian. But death sentences dolled out by social caste, by race, by ability or disability I simply cannot abide, regardless of the arithmetic.

There's a few other problems with the piece. For example, I think it is inaccurate to characterize the jsm as calling for "complete global lockdown". But I'm not going to keep harping on it. The last thing I will say about it is this: It is practical, albeit cynical, to consider the feasibility of marshaling public resources on a massive scale in a country completely unable to get its shit together enough to guarantee even the most basic of human rights to its citizens, but cynicism isn't wisdom and the depravity of the powerful should not set our vision of what is possible.
