> There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys, how's the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?” -- David Foster Wallace, "This is Water"

> We seldom study the condition of the Negro to-day honestly and carefully. It is so much easier to assume that we know it all. **Or perhaps, having already reached conclusions in our own minds, we are loth to have them disturbed by facts.** And yet how little we really know of these millions,—of their daily lives and longings, of their homely joys and sorrows, of their real shortcomings and the meaning of their crimes! All this we can only learn by intimate contact with the masses, and not by wholesale arguments covering millions separate in time and space, and differing widely in training and culture. -- W.E.B DuBois, *The Souls of Black Folk*

Race is the nightmare from which this country simply will not wake. From this country's earliest days, race was a cudgel wielded to flatten out the original sin of settler-colonialism, to massage genocidal conquest as progress and the man-made machine that fueled it as an act of god. This founding myth permeates the culture and history of the United States as completely as the air we breathe. It is, therefore, an outright mistake to think Science -- the institution, the practice, the knowledge and the people that produce it -- is exempt from the influence of racism. 

This blog post will not be enumerating a long list of examples of scientific racism (that would take several book-length posts), but rather I want to reflect on a phenomenon I've noticed whenever discussions of race come up in bio/medical spaces and that is the frequency with which people -- even putatively "anti-racist" people -- unwittingly and uncritically accept the logic of racists from the outset.

## The Logic of Racists
## 

First off, what do I mean by the "logic of racists"? This is up for some debate but I posit that racist logic assumes at least one of the following axioms to be true:

1. Humans can be divided into discrete groupings on the basis of innate characteristics.
2. There exists a natural hierarchy among humans according to innate characteristics.
3. There is an objective value system by which the value of human life can be weighed.

In addition to referring to specifically racial groupings, a hierarchy among races, and objectifying human worth on the basis of supposedly racial characteristics. Together and in context of our society, these ideas form the basis of racist, white supremacist ideology. However, I will argue that one does not need to endorse the full ideology or even more than one axiom to walk into the trap of accepting racist logic and, as a consequence, wielding science as a cudgel of racial subjugation. Generally speaking, I think these same axioms apply in many instances where science is weaponized against the marginalized and powerless, but more on that later. 

In this post, we will dive into these three axioms, their origins and some of their application in the history of science, and how we encounter them in the modern day. Before we get to that, however, we have to talk about statistics. Specifically, we have to talk about the intellectual origin of modern statistics: Eugenics.

## Measuring Man
## 

 > This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, *eugenes*, namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, eugeneia, etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word eugenics would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalised one than viriculture, which I once ventured to use. -Francis Galton, *Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development*, 1883
 
> Meanwhile, support for eugenics was sparse in Galton’s day. Near the end of his life, Galton delivered the lecture “Probability, the Foundation of Eugenics.” Lamenting that the public had not yet come around on eugenics—in particular that people still married “almost anybody” without regard to their potential for superior breeding—he predicted public opinion would be swayed “when a sufficiency of evidence shall have been collected to make the truths on which it rests plain to all.” When that happened, Galton foresaw a revolution, saying, “then, and not till then, will be a fit moment to declare a ‘Jehad,’ or Holy War against customs and prejudices that impair the physical and moral qualities of our race.” - Aubrey Clayton, "How Eugenics Shaped Statistics" *Nautilus* 2020

[In an excellent review of the intellectual influence of eugenics on the origin of statistics and statistical methods](https://nautil.us/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics-9365/), science historian Aubrey Clayton lays out how many of the modern tools of statistics were created with the express purpose of measuring variation between races and justifying the supremacy of a particular -- and very much white -- *kind* of human. From Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, and Robert Fisher come regression to the mean, the Chi-squared test, the normal distribution, Pearson correlation coefficients, *p*-values, Fisher's exact test, ANOVA; their names are eponymous with a number of mathematical tools scientists use to this day, and the genocidal movement to mold the human race to a predetermined ideal. These three men and their disciples founded eugenic societies in Britain, Europe, and the United States; lobbied for policies of mass sterilization, immigration bans, and even in the aftermath of the Holocaust and Second World War defended Nazis on the international academic stage. Adolf Hitler himself claimed to have studied Galton "deeply" and referred to Madison Grant's *The Passing of the Great Race* as "[his] bible". 

Madison Grant was not the only notable descendant of the burgeoning eugenics movement, or even the most influential. 

> Eugenics was mainstream, and it was financed by the nation's wealthiest entrepreneurs, including the Carnegie, Harriman, and Kellogg dynasties. Johns Hopkins biologist Raymond Pearl observed that, by 1912, "eugenics was catching on to an extraordinary degree with radical and conservative alike. The growth of eugenics as legitimate science owes much to the effort of Harvard-trained biologist Charles Davenport. As an associate professor at the University of Chicago, he convinced the Carnegie Institute to establish a center for the experimental investigation of eugenics in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, in 1904...In an October 10, 1910, letter, Davenport reported to Francis Galton, "There has been started here a Record Office in Eugenics; so you see that the seed sown by you is still sprouting in distant countries." - Dorothy Roberts, *Fatal Invention* 

The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory record office in eugenics was meant to serve as a grand phenotypic record of human variation, and quite overtly focused on providing raw data for the political goals of the eugenics movement. Davenport's second-in-command at Cold Spring Harbor, Harry Hamilton Laughlin, used the information from the record office to support the National Origins Act of 1924 which banned immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe to the United States. Both Davenport and Laughlin were supporters of Nazi ideas about "racial hygiene" and Laughlin even received an honorary MD from the prestigious Heidelberg University in 1936 for his efforts (Harriet Washington, *Medical Apartheid*)

These were not fringe scientists with fringe beliefs, or even prominent scientists with retrospectively "unfortunate" or "anachronistic" politics -- these men were committed to the idea of racial purification by force and marshaled their intellectual, financial, political, and social resources towards advancing that aim. The politics of eugenics and genocide were *the point* of their science, as they pursued it. All of them claimed that their political beliefs were merely inescapable conclusions from allegedly scientific observation and statistics were the tools invented for the purpose of defining them as such and they continue to be used in kind today. So, as we dive towards the intellectual root of how science is weaponized to justify and advance racism and racist ideas, keep this in mind: when scientists categorize and measure, what do we *really* mean? What do we know, and how do we know it? Are the underlying assumptions of our methods and hypotheses justified and appropriate to the question at hand? 

## Humans can be divided into discrete groupings on the basis of innate characteristics and those groupings correspond invariably to race.
## 

Let's start with a simple assumption at the heart of race "science": race is "real". To the racist, race is real in the same way that mitochondria, apple trees, and the sun are real; race is observable, reproducible, and inscribed in nature. Now, there is no question that the particular ways race is constructed in any given place and time has very real consequences for individuals. These individuals are *racialized* and experience race in the very same and very real way they experience, say, money. Driving someone into destitution or gifting them a million dollars will certainly have an impact, but "money" is no more or less inscribed in nature, or innate to individuals, or immutable than "race". 

At the heart of racial division is the division of humans on the basis of innate, so-called natural characteristics. Whether by height, skin color, facial features, bone structure, faith, tribe, and increasingly genetics every instantiation of race seeks to divide humanity into fundamentally discrete groupings or "races". Although as a matter of fact the modern social construction of race in the Western world is invariably by skin color, the bio-babble of race science relies most heavily on genetics. 

Here's a very recent example to illustrate what I mean. Recently, a white supremacist terrorist murdered several people in a Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York after posting a racist manifesto online. That manifesto cites papers from behavioral geneticists who have attempted to "explain" perceived racial gaps in certain phenotypes. Often the papers themselves are not explicitly about race. For example, one paper which was cited attempted to use GWAS to identify polygenic markers predictive of educational attainment, claiming that their data showed a greater role for genetics in predicting educational attainment, and therefore intelligence, than previously thought.  In the ensuing discussion about whether or not scientists should take responsibility for foreseeing the (extremely obvious, literally surface-level) intellectual consequences of their work, the author defended themselves by claiming that their paper simply does not support racism. 

![whoops](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FS0PrOXWQAEbRUi?format=jpg&name=small)

It doesn't take a geneticist to immediately see the way a eugenicist might leverage research like this for their ends (I would go further and say one would have to be knee-deep in eugenics themselves to even conceive of a study like this as being worthwhile), but for the purposes of the blog post lets walk through the racist thought exercise: 

A) educational attainment is strongly predicted by genetics
B) there exists a disparity between the educational attainment of Black and white people
Therefore, Black people have lower educational attainment than white people because they are intellectually, genetically inferior.

A is the main claim of the paper, and B is an empirical fact in the United States. Again, no need for the Big Brain gene to see how a paper like this could be appropriated by racists. Now, the paper itself is bad, and full of laughable linear regressions, but that's actually besides the point. The point I want to highlight is how does one even get to the point of posing the question "to what extent is educational attainment -- a 'phenotype' which literally does not exist outside of the context of our current society -- explained by genetics" and take it seriously as a scientific hypothesis? Furthermore, a deeper problem with studies of this kind is the conflation between heritability and genetic causality which often emerges in the subsequent discussion of the work if not explicitly advanced by the authors themselves. To be brief, heritability is the fraction of the variation in a phenotype correlated with a specific phenotype, but the heritability of traits does not prove or often even suggest genetic causality. For example, if your phenotype of interest is proficiency for ballet it is very likely to be heritable to some significant extent, but it certainly does not imply the existence of a "ballet gene". Similarly, I have no doubt educational attainment is heritable, but I also have no reason to believe it's a useful proxy for intelligence or that there are genes specific for "educational attainment". 

The authors defense is "the racist is wrong to think this research supports their racism" and this is a classic example of accepting the logic of the racists. I do not claim, to be perfectly clear, the author of this study is a racist (although, they might be); however, their defense here is effectively "the racists are wrong about the facts supposedly underpinning their racism." At the same time, they do not reject that it's entirely plausible that those bereft of social and real capital, marginalized and racialized into the lowest rung of the social order find themselves in their position primarily due to inferior genetics. This instance of believing that the "phenotype" of educational attainment is somehow "real" enough to be captured by genetics in a way that is generalizable, meaningful, and interpretable outside of a social context is not all that different from believing that race is also, somehow, "real". White supremacists believe their race is superior *by default*, and collecting "facts" from the world which validate that belief is effectively a confirmation of faith, the faith that what we would call the intended outcomes of supremacist violence are actually affirmations of superiority. The function of science, in the racist's worldview, is primarily to search for a "natural" justification for the constructed world, for the status quo. It is a tremendously lucrative business to produce knowledge that says "Actually, the world is the way it is because that is simply the way the world ought to be," and for 400 years science has been, with varying levels of enthusiasm, dutifully acting in the interest of preserving the existing social order.

Let's walk through another, far more common, and arguably simpler example: we've done a study and the study shows a difference between Black people and everyone else and therefore we have discovered a generalizable truth about Black people. This example is so common it might as well be a genre, the most famous of which is likely the inclusion of race as a weighted factor in the equation which estimates glomerular filtration rate (GFR) -- a proxy for kidney function -- from serum creatinine (a metabolite). 

The use of race in the estimation of kidney function began with the publication of the [MDRD equation in 1999](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.7326/0003-4819-130-6-199903160-00002). The equation was developed from a study looking at a cohort of 1600 patients (fewer than 200 of which identified as Black) by applying a stepwise regression to patient demographic and serum variables, effectively training a model to predict GFR from that data to simplify GFR measurement. In this cohort the researchers found race to be a significant component of the estimated GFR variance and therefore calculated a coefficient which would "scale" the GFR estimation for race. What this meant in practice is that if you were a clinician using this calculator, you would receive two different GFR estimations for your patient depending on whether or not your patient was Black. It was eventually replaced by the [CKD-Epi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763564/) equation in 2009, but the use of race as a weighing factor didn't change. The underlying assumption of this practice is that Black and white patients have fundamentally different kidney function on account of their race. The only attempts at quasi-scientific explanation of this baseless assumption is that Black people supposedly have greater muscle mass, and since muscle produces creatinine, this explains the observed difference in serum creatinine's ability to estimate GFR. This is, again, obviously racist nonsense and I doubt physicians were going out of their way to measure their patients muscle mass as a standard operating procedure to estimate GFR. I can't even conceive of a physician ticking the "African-American" box for a white body-builder on the bioplausibility of "more muscle equals more creatinine" alone. Are pediatric nephrologists going to seriously argue Black children need a different GFR estimation because of a putative, race-based "muscle mass" variable generated by a study in a cohort of only adult patients? 

There's good evidence that reliance on race-based estimations of GFR has led to over-estimation of kidney function in Black patients, the clinical consequences of which are quite serious and life-threatening. Systematic overestimation of GFR with either [MDRD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22264268/) or [CKD-Epi](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20519233/) caused Black patients with end-stage renal disease to be misclassified, making them [less likely to become eligible for life-saving treatments like dialysis or transplant](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2735726). And, as if that wasn't enough evidence against this practice, a meta-analysis of six studies from cohorts of entirely Black patients in sub-Saharan Africa shows that the [MDRD and CKD-Epi both systematically overestimated GFR in Black Africans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31807291/) when their respective "race-correcting" coefficients were applied. So much for linear regression discovering "generalizable truths about Black people". In spite of all of these problems, race-based GFR estimation is a common medical practice even to this day, and it's not for lack of alternatives. First, one could simply ignore the "race correction" provided by the electronic medical record when estimating GFR. Second, there's another serum biomarker -- cystatin-c -- [which can be used in addition to creatinine to reproducibly estimate GFR](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1114248), no "correction" necessary. 

Following the murder of George Floyd, there was a push at some academic institutions to reevaluate the use of race in clinical algorithms. [An idea which had until then been championed by only a small number of academic medical centers reached the hallowed pages of NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2004740), and in short order a number of major institutions abolished the practice of using race in the estimation of GFR [thanks to the years of ground work laid out by physicians, patient advocates, and scholars on the subject](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/15/8/1201). The National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology formed a joint task force in 2020 to reevaluate the practice and make a formal recommendation to the medical community, [ultimately recommending *against* the use of race in the estimation of GFR](https://www.ajkd.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0272-6386%2821%2900828-3). Although progress has been made, I would venture it is still a minority of medical centers which exclude the "race correction" from their electronic GFR calculators in the electronic medical record.

This is not the first, nor the last, instance of racialized pseudoscience having a lasting, harmful impact on medicine or biomedical research. The fact that the practice persists in spite of evidence for its harms, and professional societies recommending against race-based GFR estimation goes to show the power that race has over ostensibly reasonable and educated people. If you think critically about the subject, it is patently insane to assume that Black and white patients somehow have fundamentally different kidney function or that any observed differences therein could ever be reproduced without rigorously accounting for the myriad variables hidden within the category of "race" -- namely, the insidious, expansive, penetrating influence of *racism* on human health. 

I will give one last example of supposedly intelligent people being utterly duped by the illusion of race, albeit more subtly than in the above instances, this time from the field of ancient DNA. Molecular paleontologists like David Reich have found ways to isolate and sequence DNA from our extinct ancestors and, quite ingeniously, used these nucleic time capsules to reconstruct the ancient history of early humans and extant human ancestors, the movement and mixing of their populations across continents and time. Much of it is beautiful science and important work. But...

In 2018 David Reich wrote a tremendously successful popular science book, *Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past*, which is, for the most part, fascinating. In the epilogue, however, Professor Reich attempts to take on racist interpretations of genetics, but ends up recapitulating the logic of the racists in the process. He makes another version of the same argument, in more detail, in a NYT op-ed entitled "How Genetics is Changing Our Understanding of Race". *Exasperated Sigh*. From the outset, we can see the influence of racist logic in the title alone. How can genetics change our understanding of race, a social construct? It's like asking how genetics can change our understanding of cryptocurrency; the statement is grammatically correct nonsense. Anyways, in it Reich argues that "it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among 'races'". [In response to this, 67 academics across a number of disciplines wrote an open letter published in *Buzzfeed*, writing](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich):

> For centuries, race has been used as potent category to determine how differences between human beings should and should not matter. But science and the categories it constructs do not operate in a political vacuum. Population groupings become meaningful to scientists in large part because of their social and political salience — including, importantly, their power to produce and enforce hierarchies of race, sex, and class.

> Reich frames his argument by positing a straw man in the form of a purported orthodoxy that claims that “the average genetic differences among people grouped according to today's racial terms are so trivial when it comes to any meaningful biological traits that those differences can be ignored.” That orthodoxy, he says, “denies the possibility of substantial biological differences among human populations” and is “anxious about any research into genetic differences among populations.” 

> This misrepresents the many scientists and scholars who have demonstrated the scientific flaws of considering “race” a biological category. Their robust body of scholarship recognizes the existence of geographically based genetic variation in our species, but shows that such variation is not consistent with biological definitions of race. Nor does that variation map precisely onto ever changing socially defined racial groups.

> Reich critically misunderstands and misrepresents concerns that are central to recent critiques of how biomedical researchers — including Reich — use categories of “race” and “population.”

> For example, sickle cell anemia is a meaningful biological trait. In the US it is commonly (and mistakenly) identified as a “black” disease. In fact, while it does have a high prevalence in populations of people with West and Central African ancestry, it also has a high prevalence in populations from much of the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of the Mediterranean and India. This is because the genetic variant that causes sickle cell is more prevalent in people descended from parts of the world with a high incidence of malaria. “Race” has nothing to do with it. Thus, it is simply wrong to say that the higher prevalence of sickle cell trait in West African populations means that the racial category “black” is somehow genetic.

The full letter is very much worth the read and, frankly, makes the argument I'm trying to make in this post much more succinctly. In 2020, I revisited this letter as a part of serving on a committee for the development of a new Social Justice and Health Equity thread in the Stanford Med curriculum and wrote:

 > Scientists are woefully equipped to talk about race. This has for a long time been both baffling and humdrum to me. Baffling because so many people with so many years of training in challenging established ideas and critical thinking have such an enormous blind spot when it comes to the intersection of racism and science (science and society more broadly, even); humdrum because I know the structure of scientific production, career advancement do not require -- and, in fact, reward avoiding -- critical engagement with the subject matter. The result is not just Bad Takes but Harmful Science, particularly in medicine where the (completely made up, not at all grounded in reality) concept of biological race has direct implications for the care of human beings and is rooted in a sordid history of exploitation, theft, and abuse. 


## There exists a natural hierarchy among humans according to innate characteristics.
## 

> Captive Africans...skills at farming, carpentry, and metalworking proved immensely valuable to European capitalists...but more significant than the numerical shift from white to Black exploitation was a monumental legislative effort to differentiate the status of Blacks and whites. As officials split white indenture from Black enslavement and established "white", "Negro", and "Indian" as distinct legal categories, race was literally manufactured by law...In this acute distinction between the *political* status of whites and [Blacks], this way of governing the power relationship between them, that we find the origins of race. Colonial landowners inherited slavery as an ancient practice, but they invented race as a modern system of power. They employed Aristotle's concept of natural slaves and natural rulers to define permanent features of [Black] and white people. Race separated human beings into two fundamentally distinct groups: those who were indelibly born to be lifelong servants and those who were born to be their masters. Race radically transformed not only what it meant to be enslaved, but also what it meant to be free. - Dorothy Roberts, *Fatal Invention*

There can likely be a lot of debate about when the concept of "race", broadly defined, entered the human imagination, but there can be no doubt that the modern concept of race -- rooted as it is in the concept of white supremacy and Black subjugation -- is deeply intertwined with European colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade. It is therefore impossible to divorce the "science" of race from its utility to the powers that be. In other words, since there is no such hierarchy among races in reality, one needed to be invented to justify the violent and totalitarian apparatus which built the so-called New World and sustained the economic engine for the bleeding edge of European colonialism. The logic of the racists says that first there is a natural division amongst the races, whether in terms of "development" or inherent biological traits, which necessitates the subjugation of the "inferior" race, and finally there are the legal structures whose purpose it is to codify the "natural order". In truth, there is first the necessary material role chattel slavery plays in the project of European imperialism, then there is the enforcement of Black subjugation for this purpose through the law, and finally there is a completely manufactured but organized effort to provide a useful, psychological, pseudoscientific justification for an obviously abhorrent institution and genocidal ideology. In order to enable an emerging empire fueled by inhumanity, the victims simply had to be made to be less than human.

It is within these legal structures that precede the rise of convenient pseudoscience that we can observe directly the imprecision of race as a term without the scientific racism to buttress it. To give one example:

Japanese, and more broadly Asian, people were not seen as white or Black in the early twentieth century, leading to their inability to apply for naturalization (that is, citizenship) under the law. In *Ozawa vs. the United States* (1922) a Japanese-American immigrant who had lived for twenty years within the US, attended high school in Berkeley and graduated from the University of California before settling in Hawaii, was denied application for naturalization. This was due to the fact that the law, as written and interpreted at the time, read: "the provisions of this Title shall apply to aliens, being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent." In other parts of the world, Japanese people were included as "Honorary Aryans" (in Nazi Germany) and "Honorary Whites" in apartheid South Africa and excluded from racial prejudice under the law. In the modern day, Japanese people would most likely identify with an Asian ethnic identity which is wholly distinct from both white and Black identities. In the context of the US this might even be more granularly defined as "East Asian" ethnicity, a group often including both Japanese and Chinese people. However, Chinese people were only "Honorary Aryans" in Nazi Germany until the end of Chinese cooperation with the Nazis (after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), after which Chinese people and Chinese-Germans were persecuted under Nazi rule, and were not "Honorary Whites" in apartheid South Africa until two decades after the Japanese. The definition and social standing of race and ethnicity are far from rigid or invariant but are instead contingent on the specific place, time, and political reality. 

The scientific veneer of race science aims to "sharpen" this imprecision in order to guarantee racial exploitation continues without interruption. To invoke another example: There are diseases which are popularly and canonically taught as being strongly associated with race. For example, sickle-cell disease is a disease which to this very day is discussed as being a "Black" disease, but the truth is that sickle-cell trait co-evolved in response to the prevalence of malaria in a specific geography and populations descended from areas where malaria is endemic are more likely to have sickle-cell trait or disease. This includes people we would classify in the modern day as Asian, Latino, Black, Middle-Eastern, Arab, and, yes, white, by ethnicity. The legacy of sickle-cell as a "Black" disease descends from the medical literature of the early twentieth century and has simply persisted in spite of the enormous body of epidemiological data now available about the global burden of sickle-cell disease. Indeed, when researchers began to postulate the evolutionary link between protection against malaria and sickle-cell trait, the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the most prestigious journals in Western Medicine, published an article entitled ["Sickle Cell Anemia, A Race Specific Disease" (1947)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/290758) which argued "Sickle cell anemia...is independent of either geography or customs and habits. Its occurrence depends entirely on the presence of Negro blood, even though in extremely small amounts." This final reference to "Negro blood...in extremely small amounts"  is an unmistakable descendant of the "one drop of black blood" concept which arose from the racial necessity of US segregation -- if the Black and white races were to be divided into wholly separate societies, it was necessary for the law to have clear standards about "Black-ness" -- hence the Virginia law defining someone as legally "colored" if an individual had *any* African ancestry. This definition, of course, precludes any concept of biraciality or multiracial identity which we would recognize in the modern day, and indeed, before segregation. Or, as Langston Hughes put it in his 1940 memoir *The Big Sea*: 

> You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure. It means all Negro, therefore black. I am brown.

The concept of health and its entanglement with morality and value in the cultural imagination is deeply implicated in the racist weaponization of science. Nineteenth century naturalists believed certain kinds of afflictions were heritable, but not in the contemporary sense of a mutation in the germline being passed to a subsequent generation. These afflictions befell entire families which had transgressed against the natural order, against morality itself operating as a kind of generational karma. The idea was popularized by a German physician under the pen name Max Nordau in a novel depicting how the cumulative effects of a decadent and decaying culture and economy literally and physically degraded the bodies of a, to use the eugenic terminology, "dysgenic" family (Max Nordau, *Entartung* 1883). You don't have to look very hard to find nearly identical, more overtly racialized interpretations of the heritability of health. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood and an early advocate for birth control was also, I regret to inform you, a prominent eugenicist. 

> In her 1922 eugenics tome, *The Pivot of Civilisation*...Sanger popularized her research into the eugenic value of various types of Americans...she published a dysgenic family case history to describe the eugenic problems Black families presented: 
	
> "The parents of a feeble-minded girl, twenty years of age, who was committed to the Kansas State Industrial Farm on a vagrancy charge, lived in a thickly populated Negro district which was reported by the police to be the headquarters for the criminal element of the surrounding state"...Sanger tells us...the girl's family died early or went on to lead lives of hyperfecundity, prostitution, violent crime, or all three. - Harriet Washington, *Medical Apartheid*

This racialized view of the heritability of health is additionally complicated by the reality that the structural, psychological, social consequences of racism are all aligned to the detriment of health, leading to the well known health disparities we observe between Black and white patients. The prevalence of disease or disorders amongst the Black population are more likely to be treated or conceptualized as *essentially* Black, unlike epidemiologically analogous cases amongst whites, and therefore Black people more likely to be seen as diseased, defective *by default*. Indeed, as a medical student I can confirm this white supremacist logic is depressingly representative of the way clinical medicine continues to be taught today in many respects. Ultimately, the result is that health, while inextricably connected to racism and largely determined by social calculus in the modern day, becomes a metric by which the racist claims to have evidence of "objective" racial supremacy. Which leads us to our third and final axiom.


##  There is an objective value system by which the value of human life can be weighed and this value system corresponds to race.
## 

The consequences of such a value system go both ways; in other words, the evidence of counterexample to the ideology of white supremacy is dangerous to those interested in maintaining the racialized balance of power. For example:

> In [colonial] India, the British East India company mostly solved the problem of its mad employees by packing them off back to London, but this expedient began to fail as the numbers of white mad folk increased. The presence of crazed Europeans was an obvious threat to the ideology of white superiority, and provided an important motivation for the establishment of places where the insane representatives of the Raj could be safely hidden from public scrutiny. Only later did the colonial authorities seek to make some limited provisions for 'natives' who went mad, and only slowly did these establishments begin to import Western models of treatment and Western therapeutic techniques. - Andrew Scull, *Madness In Civilization: A Cultural History of Insanity* 

Race "science" is very selective in the criteria it deems worthy of measurement, and, therefore, of acting as a yardstick for human worth. Invariably, the chosen value system is recapitulating the underlying effects of *racism*. The examples here are fairly pure and unfiltered white supremacist ideology, you might say, and not something we would find in the modern academy. But this is a post about how scientists and academics unwittingly reinforce these very assumptions, so of course you can, most obviously through the twin mythologies of genius and merit. 

Universities, medical schools, the scientific professions are all racialized organizations. That is, they "distribute resources in ways that constrain (or enable) the expression of individual agency or the ability to shape one's future... [and] the theory [of racialized organizations] argues that Whiteness functions as a credential, providing greater access to leadership or the benefit of uneven application of formal rules and policies." ([Tiako, Ray, and South *JGIM* 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-022-07500-w)) In their article on "Medical Schools as Racialized Organizations", the authors describe how various levels of professional gatekeeping or selection which occur in medical school -- from admission to residency application -- operate in a highly racialized environment. It starts with the MCAT, the scored test which forms a full half of your numeric academic credentials when applying to medical school, which is reflexively touted as a great equalizer, or somehow a marker for intelligence. The MCAT also reflects access to resources, time, tutors, and prep courses which are disproportionately inaccessible to Black and Hispanic students for *racist*, not meritocratic reasons (Genao and Gelman, Annal. Int. Med. 2018). Extracurriculars are also not created equal, and access to academic or social capital can help some applicants enhance their application more effectively than others, not to mention having familial or professional assistance in understanding the opaque process of applying to medical school, crafting an application, and impressing interviewers. 

The racial gap in privileged professional knowledge does not disappear at the white coat ceremony either. Rather, it persists through clerkships where minority students struggle to develop a sense of professional belonging, find mentors, or are overtly discriminated against in evaluation processes which ultimately have an impact on their application to residency where minority students face lower odds of matching in comparison to their white counterparts (there's like 10 citations here in the JGIM '22 article if you're interested in diving deeper). However, discussions about evaluating medical students or the doling out of grades inevitably converge on handwringing about distinguishing the "best" medical students in a crop of applicants. In spite of the evidence of the insidious impact of racism across the entire professional trajectory of the budding student doctor, the profession stubbornly clings to mythology of merit which, in its blindness towards the racialized nature of its organizations and culture, accepts that observed differences across ethnicity or race are tolerable because of its supposed commitment to meritocracy. 

Genius, like meritocracy, is another myth and one familiar, in particular, to social and natural scientists alike. When researchers asked other researchers across a variety of fields how important innate ability, genius, or brilliance were to success in their field, the results showed a clear trend where fields in which innate ability was most valued were far less female, and less Black ([Leslie, Cimpian, Meyers and Freehand *Science* 2015](https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1261375)).

The racist stereotype which primes individuals to assume the intellectual inferiority of some kinds of people and not others is, at the very least, correlated with the ability of a field to recruit, retain, or support those individuals. As with medical schools and meritocracy, it is not innate ability or brilliance which is being measured and then applied during selection to "ensure the health" of the field, but a collection of racialized biases which are then confused for brilliance. Nevertheless, an impression or gestalt of genius built on top of racist structures is used to take the measure of individuals in the academy, and, as Leslie showed, in some fields more strongly than others. The eugenicists, of course, were similarly enthusiastic for "enriching the stock" of their field as they were for all of humanity. "A profession must have power to select its own members, rigorously to exclude all inferior types" writes Ronald Fisher (of Fisher's exact test fame, and eugenicist infamy) in *the Eugenics Review* (1917).

In the modern day, competition for artificially scarce educational resources is not limited to the professions, sciences, or even higher-ed more generally but has trickled down to the grade school level. [The NYT Daily podcast recently published an episode highlighting a storied and competitive San Francisco high school, Lowell High School](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/podcasts/the-daily/admissions-lowell-high-school-lottery-merit-system.html). In a city where the wealthy and white have largely opted out of the public school system by sending their kids to private schools with annual tuition fees in the tens of thousands, Lowell has become a highly desirable destination for academic strivers in SFUSD because of its reputation and resources. Although Lowell is a public school, until last year it used a "merit-based" admissions system to select students using grades and standardized test scores. After a racist incident at the school where an anonymous message board hosted by the school administration was flooded with anti-Black images and posts, the school was pressured by the community and especially students of color at the school to do something to improve the racial climate at the school. The school board voted to switch Lowell to a lottery admissions system, which has now been in place for a single year and had the effect of significantly increasing the diversity of the entering class. However, since that change has come into effect, it's clear that there has been a concerted backlash from parents and students at Lowell. The label "lottery kids" or "lots" has been adopted by students to derisively refer to students admitted by lottery instead of the old, supposedly "merit-based" system; as you can imagine the label is also selectively applied towards Black and brown students admitted under the lottery system, even by white students also admitted under the new rules. This is yet again another example about how the mythology of "merit" is inextricably linked to race. Regardless of what an individuals qualifications might be, they are lesser than *by default* on account of their race and therefore do not belong there. Furthermore, it is a well known phenomenon in education that increased racial integration in schools decreases the perceived prestige or desirability of a school, regardless of what has or has not changed at the school itself. Lowell is an excellent example. From one year to the next, precisely nothing had changed about the school or its resources other than the admissions system, but nevertheless students in the podcast episode explicitly expressed the concern that going to Lowell had lost some of its value and prestige, or lamented that their classmates were no longer as academically gifted or motivated. This is racism, pure and simple -- but in the zero-sum rat race that is US higher education, the perceived threat to class reproduction or class mobility embodied in the "devaluing" of an educational credential is a powerful animating political force. Indeed, San Francisco recalled three of the seven school board members in February of this year. Although turnout was low (26%), the people who did vote were highly motivated and organized around the issue of Lowell high school, [the end result being that the San Francisco school board voted two days ago to reverse course on the Lowell high school admissions system](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/recall-san-francisco-school-board.html).

The NYT Daily episode also delves into the racial dynamics of this issue between Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities in San Francisco. Given the length of this post, I won't tackle that issue here, but I do want to say that as long as education is the key vehicle to class reproduction or mobility, racialized political battles over education will be a permanent element of our society as an unavoidable consequence of a capitalist economy. We would do well to remember that the wealthy and white sectors of our society will do everything in their power, and have, to circumvent the educational rat race by either sending their kids to elite private schools with deep connections to the Olympian heights of US higher ed, or simply by cheating and fraud. The conflict between minoritized groups in our society which results from this fact is also politically expedient for the ruling class and has consistently produced the desired effects, as it has in San Francisco, such as preserving racist systems built atop fallacious concepts of "meritocracy". 

The stubborn idea that intellect can be meaningfully, objectively quantified has not only led to a more exclusive and oppressive scientific community, but has had an outsized and  enduring impact when applied to social policy. 

> Berkeley psychologist Arthur Jensen, Harvard psychologist Richard Herrnstein, and Nobel laureate William Shockley, a Stanford physicist, argued that since genes determined intelligence and intelligence determined social achievement, racial inequality resulted from Black's cognitive inferiority. The combination of Black people's lower IQ scores and higher birth rates, they warned, rendered public programs not only futile for improving Blacks' social economic status but a threat to the nation's welfare. "Is there a danger that current welfare policies, unaided by eugenical foresight, could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial segment of our total population?" Jensen asked in his 1969 *Harvard Educational Review* article, "How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?" Twenty five years later, Herrnstein and Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute rehashed the claim that social disparities stem from the higher fertility rates of genetically less intelligent groups in their controversial bestseller *The Bell Curve*. -Dorothy Roberts, *Fatal Invention*. 

It's important to notice how, yet again, adherence to fallacious racist logic that accepts the typological division of humans into separate races and then attempts to explain observed differences as primarily stemming from innate characteristics leads to scientists not just formulating racist theories, but poisoning the culture and makeup of their fields for generations as well as advocating for the advancement of even more racist and violent policies.

> ...we will look...at particular manifestations of the modern scientific ideology and the false paths down which it has led us. We will consider how biological determinism has been used to explain and justify inequalities within and between societies and to claim that those inequalities can never be changed. We will see how a theory of human nature has been developed using Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection to claim that social organization is also unchangeable because it is natural. We will see how problems of health and disease have been located within the individual so that the individual becomes a problem for society to cope with rather than society becoming a problem for the individual. And we will see how simple economic relationships masquerading as facts of nature can drive the entire direction of biological research and technology. - Richard Lewontin, *Biology as Ideology* 1991.

So, what is there to be done about this? What is the inoculum against racist logic? Well, you know, I think it's science. Real, rigorous, scientific thinking. Scientists have a mind for definitions, and when it comes to jargon or field-specific terminology tend to be quite precise but that precision evaporates when it comes time to talk about race, gender, or otherwise socially hegemonic concepts. I fully believe that the same people who have learned to live with the ever-expanding catalogue of cell types can learn to be more precise by what they mean when they talk about race. First, accepting that the project of dividing humans into discrete types whether by the contours of their skull or gene signatures is doomed from the start, and knowing why the evidence overwhelmingly points to that fact. Second, recognizing that the idea of race even as a social construct is an imprecise thing, contingent on time, geography, politics, and the law; an imprecision which precludes it from any biological utility. Third, scientists ought to think more critically about the assumptions inherent to their work and whether or not they are justified in making them, particularly when their work concerns the identities of human beings. Finally, scientists should take some level of responsibility for the social, political, economic impact of their work and collaborate with experts and scholars in the social sciences to adequately contextualize and responsibly characterize the impact of their research. Often, especially in the basic sciences, it is impossible to predict what the ultimate impact of a discovery might be -- but sometimes you're building an atomic bomb in New Mexico and it is not sufficient to simply bask in the grandeur of the destruction which might be. 

It is a common refrain of many on the right when caught in the act of terrorizing the minoritized and disenfranchised to pull back and say "I am just asking questions," or better yet "I just want to get to the truth." Science is one of the ways in which we discover (or at least approach) truths about the natural world, but it's also messy, limited, political, and a kaleidoscopic reflection of the context in which it's done -- in a word, human. Together, this means that science makes an easy cudgel, particularly when it's clear "the science" has something to say about an issue that concerns our lives, our way of life, the operation and organization of our societies on this planet, how we relate to each other and ourselves. We -- and I don't just mean scientists here -- should be constantly, ceaselessly, tirelessly, endlessly asking ourselves: "What do I know? And how do I know it?" We have to be committed to the only lives and only planet we have, and remain vigilant that science not be used as a way to prop up useful illusions like race. When ideas that aim to justify the most violent and unjust tendencies in our society creep into science, we can't let them have even a single foot in the door.
