            <div class="post-content">
                <p>This Tuesday (May 23, 2017), the White House released their budget plan for FY 2018. The budget contains deep cuts to science and research agencies ranging from a 3% cut to NASA to 18% and 30% cuts to the NIH, FDA, and EPA, respectively; in addition to these cuts, the new budget severly defunds programs for the poor, elderly, and sick.</p>

<p>Mick Mulvaney, the White House Budget Director, in answering a question from the press regarding cuts to funding for climate science, pointed to a &ldquo;climate change musical&rdquo; funded by NSF as an example of &ldquo;a waste of taxpayer money&rdquo;, as a justification for the cuts.[1] The musical in question is &ldquo;The Great Immensity&rdquo;, an off-broadway flop from <em>seven</em> years ago (not one, as Mulvaney suggested) that has been held up by right-wing media as an example of the wastefulness and exuberance of government spending on programs related to climate change. The musical won a grant for nearly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/05/23/in-trump-budget-briefing-climate-change-musical-cited-as-tax-waste-wait-what/?utm_term=.911a76fa8a4c">700,000 dollars</a> to fund its production from 2010 to 2014. While this particular musical might have been a farce, it should hardly act as a stand-in for the activities of the NSF, much less as justification for slashing the NSF&rsquo;s budget by 11% in FY2018.</p>

<p>Here is a useful graphical overview of how the NSF spends its 7 billion dollar budget (this figure represents 0.18% of the total federal budget)[2]:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/58AEnAz.png" alt="NSF" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tveT3Ce.png" alt="NSF2" /></p>

<p>The Trump Budget does include some small olive branches to science, including allocations for the BRAIN and Precision Medicine research programs headed by the NIH (the overall NIH budget, however, is threatened by an 18% cut and, should the budget pass, its institutes and centers would no longer be able to negotiate funding rates for institutional overhead and administrative costs).</p>

<p>Military spending, on the other hand, is set to increase by 10% under the new budget. A more modest increase than was proposed for FY 2017, but a substantial increase nonetheless given that military and defense spending already constitutes 54% of federal discretionary spending and 16% of all federal spending. Admittedly, there is as of yet no &ldquo;drone program&rdquo; musical, but it was recently reported by the Washington Post that the Pentagon has accumulated over 6 billion dollars over seven years in a secret &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo; by aggressively overcharging the federal government for fuel costs. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/at-the-pentagon-overpriced-fuel-sparks-allegations--and-denials--of-a-slush-fund/2017/05/20/c5ff4bf4-31b2-11e7-9dec-764dc781686f_story.html?utm_term=.f47a4ff2e33a">This slush fund has provided &ldquo;$80 million to train Syrian rebels, $450 million to shore up a prescription-drug program riddled with fraud and $1.4 billion to cover unanticipated expenses from the war in Afghanistan, according to military accounting records&rdquo;.</a> It goes without saying that no matter what the money was used for, the White House would never consider it &ldquo;wasteful&rdquo;, but for all of the racket Mulvaney made about cheating taxpayers, one would hope that they would at least be somewhat flustered at being conned out of 6 billion dollars by an agency they claim is severely underfunded.</p>

<p>The Democrats and Republicans in the highest offices would never do anything to slow the war machine. How could you, when you have lead the world into a horrific state of unending war? It is more than a little difficult to believe the White House when it insists that there is no longer any money for the poor, children, the elderly, and the sick when it continues to sell hundreds of billions of dollars of arms and military machines to the highest bidder (most recently, a 110 billion dollar contract to Saudi Arabia who continues its merciless onslaught against the Yemeni people on the back of American jets and bombs). It was no different under Obama, albeit less bold-faced. Towards the end of his second term, the U.S. ramped up its military onslaught in Africa and the Middle-East, as the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/u-s-special-operations-numbers-surge-in-africas-shadow-wars/">Intercept reported last year</a>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 2006, just 1% of commandos sent overseas were deployed in the U.S. Africa Command area of operations. In 2016, 17.26% of all U.S. Special Operations forces — Navy SEALs and Green Berets among them — deployed abroad were sent to Africa, according to data supplied to The Intercept by U.S. Special Operations Command. That total ranks second only to the Greater Middle East where the U.S. is waging war against enemies in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.&rdquo;[3]</p>

<p>At the same press conference yesterday, Mulvaney mentioned that too much attention was being paid to the recipients of taxpayer funded programs - children, the poor, the elderly, the sick, the population in general - and not enough to those who pay the taxes - the upper middle class and petit bourgeois unable to afford a good enough accountant or a substantial-enough passive income to pay what much of the ruling class does, largely nothing. I disagree. Even if there is a very large coalition of ordinary people and politicians (both Republican and Democrat) who care deeply about public health, social security, and public education, almost no attention is paid to the recipients of the bombs and bullets paid for with taxpayer money in dozens of countries all over the world, nor the exploded countries and societies they leave behind, or the intense desperation and international crises they create.</p>
