<p>For anyone wondering, my family and friends in Houston are OK as the worst of Hurricane Harvey finally begins to drift away from Houston. Some evacuated to Austin several days before the storm hit, others moved out of low-lying areas to stay at my parents&rsquo; house, which is in a higher, drier area and has the benefit of being a two-story house. Friends in the medical center have shared startling pictures like the one below (pulled from Twitter) before moving to higher ground.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIQs8NiUMAA4Mzn.jpg" alt="Ben Taub" /></p>

<p>Ben Taub, one of the largest trauma hospitals in the country, (and others) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/27/us/harvey-texas-storm.html?mcubz=0">has had to evacuate and transport patients</a> due to disruptions in the power supply, some of them in critical condition.</p>

<p>In the midst of the storm have been great displays of humanity. In addition to supplying cash (a more useful resource than things in times like these, according to the U.S National Disaster Service) to various organizations, Texans have supplied the response effort with boats, rafts, even kayaks after officials asked for more water transportation to help the many people who are stranded in - or literally on top of - their homes. Schools in drier areas (<a href="https://patch.com/texas/houston/hurricane-harvey-katy-isd-opens-shelters-2-area-high-schools">like Cinco Ranch and Morton Ranch in Katy</a>) have taken advantage of the food and space surplus created by canceled classes to open up as shelters for dislocated Houstonians. New York has even sent some of its first responders and transportation vehicles to Texas, recalling the outpouring of multi-state support in the wake of Superstorm Sandy (it should be mentioned, however, that <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/local/rep-king-says-won-hold-ted-cruz-sandy-vote-against-texas/LsXpGNe9xUHeUXHVoWKSOJ/">Texas senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn voted against a supplemental disaster bill to aid storm victims in January 2013</a>). <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/mattress-mack-will-save-you">Even Mattress Mack</a> - aye, that Mattress Mack - has opened the doors of his massive furniture galleries to Hurricane refugees. Yes, in the wake of the Hurricane there has been great tragedy, but the financial, physical, and moral support that this disaster has summoned have also given me hope. That being said, this catastrophe has dredged up some longstanding problems at the local, state, and national level that must be grappled with should we hope to minimize or even prevent the similar devastation in the future.</p>

<h1 id="houston-bayou-city">Houston, Bayou City</h1>

<p>Anyone who has lived in Houston for a significant amount of times is no stranger to floods. Indeed, the city is <em>engineered</em> to flood - but strategically. Many parks and public spaces have been designed to deliberately flood in the event of heavy rain and then drain out into the many managed waterways (<a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/explainer/article/The-trouble-with-living-in-a-swamp-Houston-7954514.php#photo-9975258">2,500 miles worth of bayous and creeks</a>) which then drain out into the Gulf. A recent Houston Chronicle article summarizes Houston&rsquo;s longtime predicament well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Things get bad when Houston floods. Water swamps homes, takes lives and shuts down the city. But it should be so much worse. There shouldn&rsquo;t even be a city here. But there is, and most Houstonians casually accept the enormous drainage system—the bayous, creeks and gullies—that keep it precariously dry in a former wetland&hellip;Therein lies the problem. Tremendous rains this year and last pushed the limits, forcing gullies and bayous over their banks into neighborhoods that brim them. The only solution is to widen the waterways, which means buying up adjacent buildings and tearing them down. Talbott puts the price tag on a total upgrade at $26 billion, which will not happen soon&hellip;Citing his own research, state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said extreme rainfall events have increased in Texas over the past century, with a particularly large increase in Houston. When the rains hit, they often hit harder than they used to. And the trend isn&rsquo;t expected to abate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The climatic trends which have culminated in this one-in-five-hundred-years storm are, of course, related to climate change as climate scientists explain in the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The mind-boggling amount of rainfall during Harvey is a function of the storm sitting by the Gulf of Mexico and continuing to draw moisture directly from it. Because of the orientation of the storm, Dr. Shepherd said, “you’ve just got this stream of moisture firehosing into the Houston region,” as the moisture is constantly replenished by the gulf. “This could go down as the worst flood disaster in U.S. history.” Scientists are increasingly able to link some extreme weather events to climate change, but when it comes to hurricanes, many say there remain a number of unknowns. What is clear, though, is that rising global temperatures warm the oceans, which causes more water to evaporate into the atmosphere. The buildup of moisture in turn contributes to the global increase in extreme rainfall, Kenneth Kunkel, a researcher with the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies, said. Even without climate change as a factor, Dr. Kunkel said, oceans are normally warm this time of year. But, he pointed out, the Gulf of Mexico has been warmer than average lately, most likely feeding into the deluge. Several scientists stressed that while the damage of Hurricane Harvey was unrelenting, it was not unexpected. Forecasters were anticipating a very wet storm to park over Houston for an extended period. “This, honestly, is playing out, unfortunately, exactly as we thought it would several days ago,” Dr. Shepherd said.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only has Houston not made the necessary efforts or expenditures to prepare for a wetter, more chaotic climate future, but the city&rsquo;s notoriously underplanned and inexorable sprawl have only made things worse (from an article already linked above):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the past twenty-five years, Houston’s concrete surface area has increased by more than 25 percent, in turn reducing the amount of absorbent marshland meant to keep East Texas’s precipitation contained. Unchecked development hasn’t done that percentage any favors, and one could argue the city could use an ordinance or two to ensure more porous ground is preserved in the city limits. Add to that a system of drainage bayous, also lined in concrete, that are notoriously clogged with debris that the city’s deemed too expensive to extract. What’s more, Houston lies on a series of giant underground salt domes, which we’ve hollowed out in oil extraction efforts over the last century, leaving the city sinking on its shallow crust. Slowly, the city is on its way to becoming a smooth and massive bowl.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A much crueler, more cynical person than me might have something to say about climate change exacting some kind of karmic punishment on the center of global resource extraction, but the truth is that Houston is a wonderful city, filled with good people from all over the world (it is, after all, the most diverse city in the country) and the energy workers of Houston are not themselves responsible for the unabated greed and oil-thirst of the energy barons who laid them off in the hundreds (perhaps thousands) after a decade of wild, unchecked exploitation of the longest running oil-boom in human history. That does not mean, however, that resource exploitation has not had both short and long-term effects for Houston. In addition to being responsible for the majority share of the city&rsquo;s (and the state&rsquo;s) wealth, poor disaster planning and infrastructure maintenance have lead to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/climatedesk-theres-an-unbearable-chemical-smell-hovering-over-parts-of-houston-and-experts-are-worried/">chemical pollutants being released <em>en masse</em></a> from Houston&rsquo;s flooded refineries and chemical plants in Harvey&rsquo;s wake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s still unclear exactly where the smells are coming from, but Parras suspects the source is the many oil refineries, chemical plants, and gas facilities nearby. Several of these plants have shut down or are in the process of shutting down due to Harvey’s historic flooding, and shutdowns are a major cause of “abnormal” emission events, according to a 2012 report from the Environmental Integrity Project. Short-term impacts of these events can be “substantial,” because “upsets or sudden shutdowns can release large plumes of sulfur dioxide or toxic chemicals in just a few hours, exposing downwind communities to peak levels of pollution that are much more likely to trigger asthma attacks and other respiratory systems.” The communities closest to these sites in Houston are disproportionately low-income and minority. There are huge public health risks from pollution releases during any hurricane, but the risk is particularly high with Harvey. The plants in the area hit directly by the storm “are responsible for roughly 25 percent of the United States’s petroleum refining, more than 44 percent of its ethylene production, 40 percent of its specialty chemical feed stock and more than half of its jet fuel,” according to the New York Times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision not to evacuate the entire city of Houston was most likely a wise one. Nobody wants to relive what happened during the hours before Hurricane Rita where a sudden evacuation order led to 100 people losing their lives, the majority of them due to evacuation efforts. However, it is my opinion that the decisions <em>not</em> to notify the mostly poor, minority residents living near Houston&rsquo;s refineries and plants of the immediate and long-term dangers of industrial pollutants being released under flooding conditions; <em>not</em> to evacuate them in time ahead of the slow-moving hurricane which was for a long time forecasted to be an immense flood-risk; <em>not</em> to order plants and refineries to shut down well ahead of the Hurricane instead of suddenly once the flooding conditions materialized - have created, together, the most significant, egregious, and overlooked threats to human health in the aftermath of this storm. Will the residents sue the refineries? The city should on their behalf. Is there insurance for chemical runoff during a flood? The question is not rhetorical, I seriously don&rsquo;t know. I hope there is, for their sake.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the last thing that has been on my mind during this Hurricane: money.</p>

<h1 id="insurance-claims-what-insurance-claims">Insurance Claims? What Insurance Claims?</h1>

<p>Two very interesting articles appeared in the Wall Street Journal this week: one describing how insurance companies <em>dont</em> consider Harvey a threat to their bottom line, and another warning of a national programs pending insolvency and the consequences it will have for the Hurricane&rsquo;s victims.</p>

<p>Wait, you might ask, didn&rsquo;t the FEMA director say that somewhere around 30,000 people would have to be sheltered and half a million would be expected to file insurance claims in the aftermath of the storm? Shouldn&rsquo;t insurance companies be scrambling for the storm-after-the-storm? The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-harvey-unlikely-to-damage-insurers-balance-sheets-1503849284">WSJ explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey’s timing is good for insurers and insurance customers from one perspective: Personal and commercial insurers have record levels of capital, the money they have on hand that isn’t required to back obligations. With insurers’ overall strong capital position, Harvey is unlikely to cause extensive damage to the industry’s financial strength, though it could hurt quarterly earnings for those carriers with blocks of business in hard-hit areas&hellip;Most residential flooding isn’t covered by private-sector insurers, but is the responsibility of the U.S. government’s National Flood Insurance Program. Many carriers, however, do sell flood insurance to businesses..<strong>.U.S. property-and-casualty insurers had $709 billion in surplus in the first quarter of the year, a record high, according to trade group the Insurance Information Institute. That means the industry had $1 in surplus for every 75 cents of net premiums.</strong>&hellip;The worst damage from the storm is expected to be caused by flooding, which largely isn’t covered by homeowners’ insurance. Home insurers protect against damage from wind, fire, hail and some other causes, but flood damage is typically borne by the National Flood Insurance Program. The U.S. program also sells coverage to small businesses and people who are renters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-harvey-threatens-largest-flood-insurer-1503771686">article in the WSJ</a> adds some important details:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hurricane Harvey poses new hazards to a giant U.S. flood insurer already facing mounting debt and a reauthorization fight in Congress. The National Flood Insurance Program, created about 50 years ago because private insurers were unwilling to risk catastrophic flood losses, could be inundated with billions of new claims following Harvey’s initial Category 4 winds and colossal rainfall. Yet the U.S. program is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30 and has just $5.8 billion left it can borrow from the Treasury to meet new claims, according to January figures reported to Congress. Many people buy the government policies through private-sector insurers, which are compensated for that service&hellip;What makes the debate in Washington, D.C. so challenging is that the program already has a debt of roughly $25 billion from earlier weather disasters.  Much of that is from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and superstorm Sandy in 2012. Sandy alone cost $8.4 billion initially, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages the program. The program had to borrow another $1.6 billion from the Treasury in January just to pay interest on its debt and storm claims, according to FEMA. It will take days, if not weeks or longer, for claims to emerge from Hurricane Harvey. More than 200,000 homes along the Texas coast could be at risk, according to information and analytics firm CoreLogic . In 30 Texas counties labeled disaster areas by the state’s governor there are nearly 450,000 NFIP policies covering $125.7 billion in insured value, according to the program’s website. More than half of that value is in heavily populated Harris County, which includes Houston. Previous interruptions of the flood-insurance program have triggered delays in thousands of home sales during the lapses&hellip;Craig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which administers a private flood-insurance program, estimates that private primary flood insurance represents about 2% of the market.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting aside for a moment that private insurers are somehow allowed to make money from selling government insurance policies, a couple of key facts come to the surface: First, private flood insurance represents only 2% of the flood insurance market, which means that 98% of the market is in public hands; second, private insurers (who saw flooding as too-risky-to-cover, thus prompting the need for a federal program) currently have a record high surplus of 709 billion dollars while the National Flood Insurance Program, financed with public dollars, is 25 billion dollars in debt and <em>still paying off interest</em> from loans used to finance the claims from 2005&rsquo;s Hurricane Katrina and 2013&rsquo;s Superstorm Sandy.</p>

<p>A third WSJ article adds another serious wrinkle to the situation - <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/08/28/much-of-houstons-flood-damage-could-be-uninsured/">many Houston homes might be completely uninsured against Harvey&rsquo;s damage</a> since 52% of homes at high risk for flooding are not federally designated flood zones.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think these facts need any additional commentary. The right, but immensely unlikely path ahead, in my opinion, is to requisition a portion of private insurers&rsquo; 709 billion dollar capital surplus to keep the National Flood Insurance Program solvent and able to respond immediately to the expected half-million insurance claims coming down the pipeline. Regular Texans have been called to give their time, money, boats, etc. in the wake of this disaster and even a rich, ultraconservative furniture mogul like Mattress Mack recognized that for just some time his massive galleries could help dislocated Houstonians seek shelter, so why shouldn&rsquo;t companies that do business in Texas be asked to do the same? After all, many of these insurance companies were the very same that were bailed out by the government in 2009 to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Maybe it&rsquo;s time for insurers to repay the favor  to some of the people that bailed them out. Furthermore, vacant properties in high-and-dry Houston areas should be requisitioned for the now temporarily or permanently homeless victims of Harvey&rsquo;s torrential flooding, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2017/jun/18/empty-properties-should-be-seized-in-emergencies-says-corbyn-video">as was suggested by Jeremy Corbyn in the U.K. following the Greenfell Tower fire</a>, in particular to relocate those people who were also affected by the pollutants and runoff coming from the flooded refineries and plants. It would be a good first step towards correcting Houston&rsquo;s longstanding and disastrous record on public housing. There is more to be said on the need for better mass, rapid transit in Texas, the kind that would make evacuating a sprawling, massive city like Houston actually feasible in a reasonable timeframe and not a deathtrap for its own residents, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day. In the meantime, I hope my Houston friends continue to stay safe.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth closing with <a href="http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Smith/">some words from the Anthropologist Neil Smith</a> who, sometime after Katrina, famously said &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as a natural disaster&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is generally accepted among environmental geographers that there is no such thing as a natural disaster. In every phase and aspect of a disaster – causes, vulnerability, preparedness, results and response, and reconstruction – the contours of disaster and the difference between who lives and who dies is to a greater or lesser extent a social calculus. Hurricane Katrina provides the most startling confirmation of that axiom. This is not simply an academic point but a practical one, and it has everything to do with how societies prepare for and absorb natural events and how they can or should reconstruct afterward. It is difficult, so soon on the heels of such an unnecessarily deadly disaster, to be discompassionate, but it is important in the heat of the moment to put social science to work as a counterweight to official attempts to relegate Katrina to the historical dustbin of inevitable “natural” disasters.&rdquo;</p>
