                <p>I haven&rsquo;t made a new blog post in large part because I felt that everything I was writing sounded the same. I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that I write primarily for clarity but the last couple of posts took on this almost proselytizing tone that really irked me in retrospect; I was trying to convince some imaginary person of something I had already sorted for myself. The internet doesn&rsquo;t need another screed gallery. I want to write (and read) more this year. My writing is still too amateur for me to be comfortable sending it anywhere and my fiction is exclusively unfinished so the blog is still the best place for me to put stuff out there. To the three people that read it, I apologize and am eternally grateful.</p>

<p>The second reason I haven&rsquo;t posted is that I moved to England and that&rsquo;s, as they say, a whole thing. After settling in, I noticed that I have more creative energy, not less as I had expected. I wager that this newfound energy has to do with two things: grad school and Cambridge itself. Unlike undergrad, there is one and only one demand on my attention during the working week and that&rsquo;s research; moreover, when and how I devote my attention to my research is almost completely under my control. I have always had this vague sense, starting in high school, that graded work was essentially a sham and totally unnecessary for a fruitful education. Three months in grad school has confirmed that. The time I don&rsquo;t spend worrying about courses, grades, and assignments I spend thinking about research. The more I think about research, the more I crave anything but science when I get home. As a result, I&rsquo;ve read more consistently in these past three months than maybe any other point in my life (about a book a week). Second, Cambridge is a pretty ideal city to have this kind of cognitive freedom. A thirty minute walk will get you just about anywhere else in town &ndash; plenty of time to daydream. It&rsquo;s also a quiet town so there&rsquo;s not much else to do <em>but</em> daydream on most days. Driving takes more mental energy than we know.</p>

<p>In the spirit of the new year, I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my favorite things from 2017.</p>

<p><em>Favorite Things</em></p>

<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413bzhiG5xL._SX336_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Temporary People" /></p>

<p><em>Temporary People</em> is a collection of vignettes, shorts, and poems about migrant workers in the Persian Gulf. In spite of being essentially a series of variations on a theme each chapter never fails to surprise you. Deepak&rsquo;s stylistic range elevates what could&rsquo;ve been a brief exercise in pounding maxims into the ground into a mosaic that shifts ever so slightly, like a kaleidoscope, like jazz, into something fresh and new from one moment to the next. The final product is a book that is witty, funny, cutting, at times absurd, and, most of all, deeply moving. My first reaction upon finishing the collection for the first time was that something inarticulable in my soul had been reflected on the page. In other words, this book was, for me, deeply cathartic.</p>

<p><img src="https://sulfurreviews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/thetatamigalaxy1.jpg?w=886" alt="Tatami Galaxy" /></p>

<p><em>Tatami Galaxy</em> is an 11 episode anime series from studio Madhouse (fans of <em>Paprika</em>, <em>Perfect Blue</em>, <em>Paranoia Agent</em> will see some aesthetic similarities) that originally aired in 2010 after being adapted from the 2004 novel of the same name. If you had told me that it was possible to transform the basic conceit of the borderline unwatchable Endless Eight arc from <em>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</em> into something that is not only tolerable television but one of the most compelling and exciting works of animation ever made then I would&rsquo;ve laughed in your face. The director of the anime adaptation, Masaaki Yuasa, has accomplished just that. To be blunt, Yuasa is a fucking genius. Each and every sequence is beautifully composed and paced. <em>Tatami</em> takes full advantage of the medium in ways that far too many anime are unwilling, maybe even afraid, to do. At the core of <em>Tatami&rsquo;s</em> plot is a very simple love story, but beyond that its a show about venturing out into the adult world for the first time, about standing at the precipice of all of life&rsquo;s possibilities and realizing that you don&rsquo;t have a goddamn clue what to do about it. This show is a must watch for people close to the undergraduate experience. I&rsquo;m glad I found it when I did. The same team behind <em>Tatami Galaxy</em> released a movie set in the same universe last year and I can&rsquo;t wait to see it.</p>

<p><em>This one passage from David Jones&rsquo; &lsquo;In Parenthesis&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><em>In Parenthesis</em> was written by a Welsh painter, David Jones, who, having spent three years on the western front as an infantryman, did not feel the literature of the day really captured what it was truly like to be in the war and decided to tell the story in his own way. The result is a challenging epic poem of sorts pepperred with some of the most striking prose I&rsquo;ve ever read. So, I forgot to pack this book in my backpack when I came to England so I didn&rsquo;t get to finish it in 2017. I look forward to picking it back up. One passage has stuck with me vividly and I&rsquo;ll reproduce it here. The passage describes the regiment&rsquo;s first encounter with mustard gas:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The exact disposition of small things - the precise shapes of trees, the tilt of a bucket, the movement of a straw, the disappearing right boot of Sergeant Snell - all minute noises, separate and distinct, in stillness charged through with some approaching violence - registered not by the ear nor any single faculty - an on-rushing pervasion, saturating all existence; with exactitude, logarithmic, dial-timed, millesimal - of calculated velocity, some mean chemist&rsquo;s contrivance, a stinking physicist&rsquo;s destroying toy.
 He stood alone on the stones, his mess-tin spilled at his feet. Out of the vortex, rifling in the air it came – bright, brass-shod, Pandoran; with all-filling screaming the howling crescendo’s up-piling snapt. The universal world, breath held, one half second, a bludgeoned stillness. Then the pent violence released a consummation of all burstings-out; all sudden up-rendings and rivings-through – all taking-out of vents – all barrier-breaking – all unmaking. Pernitric begetting – the dissolving and splitting of solid things.&rdquo;</p>
