                <p>Fresh off a year-long stint in England and finding myself in New Haven with nothing to do, I wandered into George Shaw&rsquo;s exhibit at the Yale Center for British Art. The exhibit, &ldquo;A Corner of a Foreign Field,&rdquo; is nothing short of massive with over one-hundred individual works of art. Shaw&rsquo;s most celebrated paintings are landscapes of his childhood home, the Tile Hill estate houses. Stepping from one painting to the next, I imagined myself ambling through Tile Hill as Shaw might, mapping the memories of his youth onto the estranged hinterlands of his once familiar neighborhood. Our every recollection reshapes our memories and maybe none are more revisited than those of childhood. Freud didn&rsquo;t spend much time in the good graces of his fellow physicians but there are aspects of his work that through the penetrating influence of art have transfixed themselves into our subconscious as easily as our earliest sexual fantasies, phobias, obsessions, ecstasies, traumas. By the time we reach adulthood these pockmarks on our subconscious — once sharp, black, and well-defined — have long since come out of focus. We reload these memories through our gray matter and the faces become more uncanny, names jumble, places and dates rearrange, entire episodes are fabricated. The space outside our mind, too, changes. Once a lively working class community, Tile Hill stands in, unwillingly no doubt, for the aging, emptying, crumbling suburban communities whose malaise and subsequent rage partly fueled Britain&rsquo;s self-amputation from the European Union. In one scene, Shaw captures St. George&rsquo;s flag flying high over a garden fence; a display of open nationalism still rare in Britain and, indeed, more pointed in the present day where the line between ethnic and garden-variety nationalism is drawn uncertainly in the ideological dirt.</p>

<p>Shaw&rsquo;s landscapes are devoid of human life but for a few scenes where the artist&rsquo;s shadow is cast long on the ground. My first thought brought me back to my own suburban upbringing and my ambivalence to how isolating, wasteful, and atomizing it was. Shaw&rsquo;s subjects — empty parks, disheveled lots, and wooded clearings decorated with fading graffiti — draw attention to this emptiness by highlighting the imperfections and asymmetries left by the footprints of has-beens, the detritus of life. One moving tryptic, &ldquo;My Back to Nature&rdquo;, makes great use of this concept to explore themes of childhood and adolescence. In the first painting, a creased blue tarp hangs from a branch in the forest. The photorealistic texture of the tarp dominates your attention and, for me, summoned personal memories of that universal childhood game borne from the budding yearning for a private life that, at that age, could only be found in your imagination: building improvised forts with my friends. The second painting was of dozens of pornographic images sprawled out in front of a pitch black grotto breaking up a wall of impenetrable greenery. It&rsquo;s not difficult to imagine how they got there: teenagers slinking off into the woods, equal parts giddy and guilty. The only human forms in Shaw&rsquo;s paintings appear in shadows and pornography. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the exhibit also featured hundreds of Shaw&rsquo;s sketches, many of them recreations of spreads from pornographic magazines so explicit that (I&rsquo;m truly embarrassed to admit) I tried not to linger too long on them lest the other (mostly elderly) visitors get any ideas. I blame my shameful prudishness on my core childhood trauma, Catholicism, which Shaw and I both managed to survive. The final painting in the tryptic, a streak of red paint smeared bloody on the trunk of a tree, marks the end of adolescence with a kind of metaphorical death. You can come back to the place but you can never return to those precise feelings of dysphoria, ambition, confusion, and infinite possibilities. That&rsquo;s the feeling Shaw captures so compellingly in his work: nostalgia, the pain of returning home.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve ever felt a connection to a place as deep and anchoring as the bond Shaw must clearly share with Tile Hill. I was brought up piecemeal in Venezuelan cities, Houston apartments, suburban Texas, and never felt particularly attached to any physical place. Home, to me, is <em>placeless</em> and more ambiguous; home is more of a sense, a feeling than a place on a map. When I&rsquo;m with my people, I&rsquo;m at home although who those people are, exactly, is not particularly clear to me beyond a few obvious candidates. I have difficulty imagining myself connected to an unpopulated place. I find the countryside beautiful, but could never truly be happy in it; similarly, cities are exhausting but the great number and kinds of people also brings me a great deal of comfort, strength even in anonymity. Suburbia is an in-between sort of place: bereft of anything resembling beauty, repetitive, populated but homogenous and so thoroughly segregated in every sense of the word that the most common social activity is stewing in stalled traffic with your neighbors (one car per head, windows up, muzak pumping). Nevertheless, Shaw&rsquo;s work is able to connect and move you precisely because of how acutely and profoundly situated it is at the place the artist&rsquo;s mind meets Coventry. It has been said the artist&rsquo;s job is to make the specific universal and in that respect &ldquo;A Corner of a Foreign Field&rdquo; is an exemplary artistic achievement as it captures the artist&rsquo;s personal feelings for and of a place that could not be more outwardly mundane.</p>

<p><img src="https://maruanimercier.com/sites/maruanimercier.com/files/styles/fullscreen/public/artists/GS%202017%20The%20Painted%20Wall%20-%20GSHA00808.jpg?itok=OAR2URhR" alt="The Painted Wall" width="700"/></p>

<p>Shaw&rsquo;s imagery sometimes borders on the surreal and is therefore in many places emotionally ambiguous, even discomforting. That said, a few pieces are resoundingly and clearly pessimistic in tone and content. <em>The End of Pleasure</em>, <em>The End of Work</em>, <em>The End of Care</em>, and <em>We are Making an Old World</em> stand out from the rest of Shaw&rsquo;s <em>ouvre</em> as particularly apocalyptic. A crumbling social club, abandoned factories, a flattened elderly care facility, and a bloody sky stretching over dead trees and rusty fences: scenes from the decay of public life. These terminal landscapes broker no hope for the future. They signal that the promises of work, sociality, and mutual aid — the cornerstones of a dignified and communitarian life — which once formed the bedrock of a universal vision of society have been broken, maybe forever. This is the pain of squinting into an uncertain future through an oblique memory, of backpedalling into the horizon. Yet, the despair summoned by the accounting of what is lost illuminates what it is about those now rotting heaps and overgrown slabs of concrete which was once so essential to us.</p>
